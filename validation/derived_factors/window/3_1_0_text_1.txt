The qyyis factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the eogjc factor and has three levels: "jcndf", "chjln", and "the". If the eogjc on the previous trial is "tflo" and the eogjc on the current trial is not "tflo", then the trial is considered a "jcndf". If the eogjc on the previous trial is not "tflo" and the eogjc on the current trial is "dizicq", then the trial is considered a "chjln". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "the".
