The abobi factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the hmi, pkyoho, and efzpc factors. It has three levels: "zebmpm", "ury", and "ljy". If the pkyoho on the current trial is the same as the hmi on the previous trial and the hmi on the current trial is not the same as the efzpc on the previous trial, then the trial is "zebmpm". If the pkyoho on the current trial is not the same as the hmi on the previous trial and the hmi on the current trial is the same as the efzpc on the previous trial, then the trial is "ury". Otherwise, the trial is "ljy".
