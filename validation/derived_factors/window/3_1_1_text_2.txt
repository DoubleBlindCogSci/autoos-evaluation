The yknaja factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the psxzzw factor and has three levels: "sxxi", "hsrtsa", and "ile". If the psxzzw two trials back is "spa" and the psxzzw on the current trial is not "spa", then the trial is considered a "sxxi". If the psxzzw two trials back is not "spa" and the psxzzw on the current trial is "iigdr", then the trial is considered a "hsrtsa". Otherwise, the trial is considered an "ile".
