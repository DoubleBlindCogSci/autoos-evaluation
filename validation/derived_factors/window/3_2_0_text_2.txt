The odsxra factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the qbr and lpnhi factors and has three levels: "kdby", "ucb", and "tnqpc". If the qbr on the current trial is "oze" and the lpnhi on the previous trial is not "hmhisr", then the trial is considered a "kdby". If the qbr on the current trial is not "oze" and the lpnhi on the previous trial is "hmhisr", then the trial is considered a "ucb". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "tnqpc".
