The ftubtu factor depends on the transition of the hruxe and whb factors and has three levels: "mzyagu", "mlgu", and "glezlm". If the hruxe on the previous trial is "ejbn" and the whb on the current trial is not "ixvf", then the trial is considered a "mzyagu". If the hruxe on the previous trial is not "ejbn" and the whb on the current trial is "ixvf", then the trial is considered a "mlgu". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "glezlm".
