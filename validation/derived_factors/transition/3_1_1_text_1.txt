The abmuxe factor depends on the transition of the bid factor and has three levels: "cbnphq", "xbl", and "oftp". If the bid on the previous trial is "ttssnv" and the bid on the current trial is not "nqhf", then the trial is considered a "cbnphq". If the bid on the previous trial is not "ttssnv" and the bid on the current trial is "nqhf", then the trial is considered a "xbl". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "oftp".
