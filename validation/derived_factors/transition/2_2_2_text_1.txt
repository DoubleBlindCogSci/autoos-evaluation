The hpbajg factor depends on the transition of the xkth and phtyd factors and has two levels: "bknevy" and "agynv". If the xkth on the current trial is not "ibjto" and the phtyd on the previous trial is not "ooqwku", then the trial is considered a "bknevy". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "agynv".
