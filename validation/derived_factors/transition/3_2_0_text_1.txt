The uaioe factor depends on the transition of the etw, qkmfhd, and qcftj factors and has three levels: "pozw", "wsm", and "azb". If the qcftj on the previous trial is the same as the etw on the current trial and the etw on the previous trial is not the same as the qkmfhd on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "pozw". If the qcftj on the previous trial is not the same as the etw on the current trial and the qkmfhd on the current trial is the same as the etw on the previous trial, then the trial is considered a "wsm". Otherwise, the trial is considered an "azb".
