The uaioe factor depends on the transition of the etw, qkmfhd, and qcftj factors and has three levels: "pozw", "wsm", and "azb". If the qcftj on the current trial matches the etw on the previous trial and the etw on the current trial does not match the qkmfhd on the previous trial, then the trial is considered a "pozw". If the qcftj on the current trial does not match the etw on the previous trial and the etw on the current trial matches the qkmfhd on the previous trial, then the trial is considered a "wsm". Otherwise, the trial is considered an "azb".
