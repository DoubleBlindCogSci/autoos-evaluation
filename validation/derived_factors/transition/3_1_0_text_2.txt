The xzsh factor depends on the transition of the ahpu factor and has three levels: "dhvhl", "ysbhd", and "ryb". If the ahpu on the current trial is "kbq" and the ahpu on the previous trial is not "vwqq", then the trial is considered a "dhvhl". If the ahpu on the current trial is not "kbq" and the ahpu on the previous trial is "vwqq", then the trial is considered a "ysbhd". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "ryb".
