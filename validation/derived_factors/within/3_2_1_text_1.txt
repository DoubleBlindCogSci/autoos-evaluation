The iaca factor depends on the rrjaqh, judsc, and tig factors and has three levels: "vbejzt", "vdj", and "pnph". If the rrjaqh factor matches the judsc factor, then the trial is "vbejzt". If the rrjaqh factor does not match the judsc factor but matches the tig factor, then the trial is "vdj". Otherwise, the trial is "pnph".
