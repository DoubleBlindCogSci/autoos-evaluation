There are three regular factors: Clbl#yEkS, kBy)_X4Hzqe, and o3KWHkza^OToog. The Clbl#yEkS factor consists of eight levels: "X(AhOV}92WFgm", "gtVJUIWy", "PwCySm", "yfdXy", "eHsosCM9F{Ude", ":y3myCEKIH", "VjOd", and "WW}qiwP~e". In the Clbl#yEkS factor, the level "X(AhOV}92WFgm" occured five times as often as the level "yfdXy". The level "VjOd" occured once as often as the level "yfdXy". The kBy)_X4Hzqe factor consists of six levels: "QcS", "aPBFuz", "tqzmGY22HJEB", "7EEOYi^EOMna8l", "kV#hdR", and "OXgHrjGR;@nao". In the kBy)_X4Hzqe factor, the level "QcS" occured nine times as often as the level "tqzmGY22HJEB". The level "7EEOYi^EOMna8l" occured ten times as often as the level "tqzmGY22HJEB". The level "kV#hdR" occured three times as often as the level "tqzmGY22HJEB". The o3KWHkza^OToog factor consists of eight levels: "SDSIwiqI?JlFk", "xOJ", "mkNGovUra2Xm", "ZZkDSRH ;Aypo", "W[&MuToGOvq", "Pm|IQ", "wMXYVAGALX", and "zb?yZ|yqDHlcRq". In the o3KWHkza^OToog factor, the level "W[&MuToGOvq" occured nine times as often as the level "zb?yZ|yqDHlcRq".
