There are three regular factors: aCxZeoeIL3juMW, Yvxqae, and mEpmn;lMKd?. The aCxZeoeIL3juMW factor consists of nine levels: "u?v_KojSN|WPkS", "Lq?FQcPOtb0nWj", "v)StcoGOF", "AxszFnNWuiI", "eweZMTbkNOD^", "dFcgB", "gHPSg", "QWNm", and "gqeq". In the aCxZeoeIL3juMW factor, the "u?v_KojSN|WPkS" level occured four times as often as the "Lq?FQcPOtb0nWj" level. The "v)StcoGOF" level occured three times as often as the "Lq?FQcPOtb0nWj" level. The Yvxqae factor consists of nine levels: ":@C tggT>F0)NH", "NLsPUZqahHqnL", "vZom[QL", "ZMyqTbglCTDi0", "NkTvHpRSBqz", "Btt7", "tkT$FZJ", "JLX)", and "Bdm". In the Yvxqae factor, the ":@C tggT>F0)NH" level occured seven times as often as the "NLsPUZqahHqnL" level. The "vZom[QL" and "ZMyqTbglCTDi0" level occured twice as often as the "NLsPUZqahHqnL" level. The mEpmn;lMKd? factor consists of nine levels: "TxWoCsPHzHTAV", "RYY!oBjzT[qy", "b6lkWxOWN", "|ZPSx1L", "0jeea", "9ZiOey7", "q WNxi:F[BY", "L6qqLLzMeAuz", and "SoZ". In the mEpmn;lMKd? factor, the "TxWoCsPHzHTAV" level occured three times as often as the "RYY!oBjzT[qy" level.
