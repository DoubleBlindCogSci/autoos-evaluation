In the Wx& factor, the level "& uMPiooLVY" occured once as often as the level "xjcu". The level "WJTqLh$ NzW" occured nine times as often as the level "xjcu". The MnXagrJn_mn factor consists of three levels: "BgJ%@Vy1bae", "Kqi4LqXZvB}cPN", and "uQwpFRFvVea". In the MnXagrJn_mn factor, the level "Kqi4LqXZvB}cPN" occured seven times as often as the level "BgJ%@Vy1bae". The level "uQwpFRFvVea" occured once as often as the level "BgJ%@Vy1bae".
