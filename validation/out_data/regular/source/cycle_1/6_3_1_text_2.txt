In the RBo factor, the "jOcz" and "$vqBxq" level occured seven times as often as the "YQILxAcQYra" level. The ZcOY factor consists of seven levels: "VFeDO%4:", "GDGohhXiJe;", "m#eYvv<HIEwIN", "TyNGASA$Ryheot", "JiUgRKF", "fvDDe", and "BQmvXeGpYvev*M". In the ZcOY factor, the "VFeDO%4:" level occured four times as often as the "GDGohhXiJe;" level. The "m#eYvv<HIEwIN" level occured three times as often as the "GDGohhXiJe;" level. The nbgswoYdxzc? factor consists of three levels: "6FnN HJhVlK", "SNIarJ", and "wRx9kbOkRg". In the nbgswoYdxzc? factor, the "6FnN HJhVlK" and "SNIarJ" level occured seven times as often as the "wRx9kbOkRg" level.
