There are three regular factors: Clbl#yEkS, kBy)_X4Hzqe, and o3KWHkza^OToog. The Clbl#yEkS factor consists of eight levels: "X(AhOV}92WFgm", "gtVJUIWy", "PwCySm", "yfdXy", "eHsosCM9F{Ude", ":y3myCEKIH", "VjOd", and "WW}qiwP~e". In the Clbl#yEkS factor, the "X(AhOV}92WFgm" level occured five times as often as the other levels. The kBy)_X4Hzqe factor consists of six levels: "QcS", "aPBFuz", "tqzmGY22HJEB", "7EEOYi^EOMna8l", "kV#hdR", and "OXgHrjGR;@nao". In the kBy)_X4Hzqe factor, the "QcS" level occured nine times as often as the other levels. The "7EEOYi^EOMna8l" level occured ten times as often as the other levels. The "kV#hdR" level occured three times as often as the other levels. The o3KWHkza^OToog factor consists of eight levels: "SDSIwiqI?JlFk", "xOJ", "mkNGovUra2Xm", "ZZkDSRH ;Aypo", "W[&MuToGOvq", "Pm|IQ", "wMXYVAGALX", and "zb?yZ|yqDHlcRq". In the o3KWHkza^OToog factor, the "W[&MuToGOvq" level occured nine times as often as the other levels.
