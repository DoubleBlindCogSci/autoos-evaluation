There are two regular factors: 0D{b~bxWrwQ[ and ?^i. The 0D{b~bxWrwQ[ factor consists of seven levels: "cEG|AN", "AxYZHAuaw:KhLA", "#ynLG<LYipZUi", "WWJYaXjVdZjk{", "gT (ibn|nvV", "ShtIhkGJAUZ>c", "YD EuFMgoO", and "AzRHf". In the 0D{b~bxWrwQ[ factor, the level "ShtIhkGJAUZ>c" occured ten times as often as the other levels. The ?^i factor consists of six levels: "YDbPSaXjqFd(", "iwx", "vOb2$Yfyz5", "5aZM<", "GQmm?Gq", "vRPsA)vO#7z", and "!vT". In the ?^i factor, the level "iwx" occured six times as often as the other levels. The level "vRPsA)vO#7z" occured ten times as often as the other levels. The level "!vT" occured once as often as the other levels.
