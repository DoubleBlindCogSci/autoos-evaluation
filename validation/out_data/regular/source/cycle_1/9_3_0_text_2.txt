There are three regular factors: _HAzv, RabtMGmqX, and LFsvlDVeGo$. The _HAzv factor consists of nine levels: "gr&GSlM", "9xdOnDHGXf", "UNOTTFk)AFMq0", "U1*mng J", "BZysJvDInew", "FSHhEAThvq4", "{{BS", "FtPqFz", and "AdpSV|TDjYLoN". The RabtMGmqX factor consists of nine levels: "ZgGspLf nfkGor", "uWf;kYbym#JIk", "kMHQP", "{u3K EaIG", "*FChWzjw", "L}d", "QhJJMKxIbjFcEk", "CGC", and "Mvd". In the RabtMGmqX factor, the "ZgGspLf nfkGor" level occured nine times as often as the "uWf;kYbym#JIk" level. The "kMHQP" and "{u3K EaIG" level occured three times as often as the "uWf;kYbym#JIk" level. The LFsvlDVeGo$ factor consists of nine levels: "EZWxy>hD6h", "G7~sZf VBE$r", "DSVIcFpZBQZ", "utGw", "uzZQFDKw]WIe", "OxkwKnHt?", "rW>S&p", "Y1TaFMKq tRA", and "bDJVif". In the LFsvlDVeGo$ factor, the "EZWxy>hD6h" level occured three times as often as the "G7~sZf VBE$r" level.
