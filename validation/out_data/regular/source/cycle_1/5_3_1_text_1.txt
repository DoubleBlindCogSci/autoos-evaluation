The wGgWr factor consists of six levels: "SNL", "FSH", "cxlmR", "enWvs]SdPQfU", "FMyr_g3lEfn", and "pXBiAxc|". In the wGgWr factor, the level "SNL" occured nine times as often as the level "FSH". The level "enWvs]SdPQfU" occured twice as often as the level "FSH". The level "FMyr_g3lEfn" occured ten times as often as the level "FSH". The ynYzCPvL%mPs factor consists of five levels: "dQstz?fp)Um", "CziVPGnK", "Kpt", "kyhQSeMg", and "jtcK".
