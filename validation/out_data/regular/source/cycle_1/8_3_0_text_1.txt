There are three regular factors: nmCqS Q, !MVb, and LMIBd{RN. The nmCqS Q factor consists of nine levels: "bjLAX_e", "<AxMNV", "cLx!hbAF", "Eify", "hdJNxVjQu%YMx", "NjGk", "JjeVDq*T8sUxgb", "IDHq", and "igjzQGT!!bqxO". In the nmCqS Q factor, the "bjLAX_e" level occured ten times as often as the "<AxMNV", "Eify", "hdJNxVjQu%YMx", "NjGk", "JjeVDq*T8sUxgb", "IDHq", and "igjzQGT!!bqxO" level. The "cLx!hbAF" level occured twice as often as the "<AxMNV", "Eify", "hdJNxVjQu%YMx", "NjGk", "JjeVDq*T8sUxgb", "IDHq", and "igjzQGT!!bqxO" level. The "<AxMNV" and "Eify" level occured in the ratio 3 to 3. The "IDHq" level occured five times as often as the "hdJNxVjQu%YMx", "NjGk", "JjeVDq*T8sUxgb", and "igjzQGT!!bqxO" level. The "igjzQGT!!bqxO" level occured seven times as often as the "hdJNxVjQu%YMx", "NjGk", and "JjeVDq*T8sUxgb" level. The !MVb factor consists of eight levels: "N[sLUNL", "uliPi>L{vYZu<", "D@KQ mM", "KcXYF9nJW", "4EfGTqk[] M", "QjUXhkmxGl", "JvHTCWUAS&{", and "Q aCECGmsOF0V". In the !MVb factor, the "N[sLUNL" level occured six times as often as the "uliPi>L{vYZu<", "D@KQ mM", "KcXYF9nJW", "4EfGTqk[] M", "QjUXhkmxGl", "JvHTCWUAS&{", and "Q aCECGmsOF0V" level. The "Q aCECGmsOF0V" level occured ten times as often as the "uliPi>L{vYZu<", "D@KQ mM", "KcXYF9nJW", "4EfGTqk[] M", "QjUXhkmxGl", and "JvHTCWUAS&{" level. The LMIBd{RN factor consists of eight levels: "Jbfn", "uj3N]t<dcgr", "Bd~Uhe(eHn", "WZw:NZj", "NyZQVF4JR|QWvw", "Lhe^Xnx", "JMeoz_WQO", and "7pbBGocj". In the LMIBd{RN factor, the "NyZQVF4JR|QWvw" level occured three times as often as the "Jbfn", "uj3N]t<dcgr", "Bd~Uhe(eHn", "WZw:NZj", "JMeoz_WQO", and "7pbBGocj" level. The "Lhe^Xnx" level occured four times as often as the "Jbfn", "uj3N]t<dcgr", "Bd~Uhe(eHn", "WZw:NZj", "JMeoz_WQO", and "7pbBGocj" level.
