There are two regular factors: 3yQfAn and dqmk7. The 3yQfAn factor consists of ten levels: "XX4", "wyf", "2pcKqE! FL7e", "OEnwYLpU", "Kip>;x", "PkY", "kKQBbMoDy", "RYyUHBNdcrYra", "adPD7VChaem", and "RWthALArH1". In the 3yQfAn factor, the "RYyUHBNdcrYra" level occured ten times as often as the "XX4", "wyf", "2pcKqE! FL7e", "OEnwYLpU", "Kip>;x", "PkY", "kKQBbMoDy", "adPD7VChaem", and "RWthALArH1" level. The "adPD7VChaem" level occured seven times as often as the "XX4", "wyf", "2pcKqE! FL7e", "OEnwYLpU", "Kip>;x", "PkY", "kKQBbMoDy", and "RWthALArH1" level. The dqmk7 factor consists of nine levels: "RQZ5[aV!N9btRm", "%NcL", "n]3Uq<AeizKA", "wY)ph", "ugu", "xkeXsnDX", "xxRs$f[", "uDPJZY{$knh9", and "lt8". In the dqmk7 factor, the "RQZ5[aV!N9btRm" level occured twice as often as the "%NcL", "n]3Uq<AeizKA", "wY)ph", "ugu", "xkeXsnDX", "xxRs$f[", "uDPJZY{$knh9", and "lt8" level. The "lt8" level occured twice as often as the "%NcL", "n]3Uq<AeizKA", "wY)ph", "ugu", "xkeXsnDX", "xxRs$f[", and "uDPJZY{$knh9" level.
