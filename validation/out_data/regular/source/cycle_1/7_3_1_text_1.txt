There are three regular factors: sZxB)k(, hrYqFG, and CTb. The sZxB)k( factor consists of nine levels: "Zkx", "dKWtWQrOAQFfz", "%>QH:WjhvIM", "S$ OwGDsUW", "BPNO[Gkigk", "0viLZCm<qsj", "QxDuSEy", "E|YHXMn8ONxhIR". In the sZxB)k( factor, the level "BPNO[Gkigk" occured eight times as often as the other levels. The hrYqFG factor consists of seven levels: "ZrF", "r*a3yhl^t", "&HdXvp]dcIM", "lQTwqZ", "lJA5tcEWomCqB", "kzZKEWr^v", "lJrxL(BNChimdM". In the hrYqFG factor, the level "lJA5tcEWomCqB" occured ten times as often as the other levels. The level "r*a3yhl^t" occured six times as often as the other levels. The CTb factor consists of seven levels: "Qzq", "MCjEVcQ!~z~5V", "sNWxfAx(L]Sv", "yCYNI", "%se2nV", "IPeluGRK4I", "rex@G|y8{vpxPD". In the CTb factor, the level "sNWxfAx(L]Sv" occured nine times as often as the other levels.
