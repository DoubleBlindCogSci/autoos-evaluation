There are two regular factors: jUf;GSNjsdU<E? and BRpwg n. The jUf;GSNjsdU<E? factor consists of six levels: "wsnZnqLWlD", "a$tmZO", "EL(zDtnWikAAw", "TMm5ZB", "CzhjVwxjc1?cbV", and "rPfCErTNe". In the jUf;GSNjsdU<E? factor, the level "rPfCErTNe" occured three times as often as the other levels. The BRpwg n factor consists of six levels: "]^F", "8bdJ", "w_e};^C@NPhWM", "TnOQoUDtN", "]QCdmJ", and ";gMlwG". In the BRpwg n factor, the level "TnOQoUDtN" occured five times as often as the other levels.
