There are three regular factors: xY0YmMZJTM, ijn&HvqnYiIX6*, and CgcZmD&XulWR. The xY0YmMZJTM factor consists of four levels: "iZEiP", ";it", "ez[RDJxx", and "giO". In the xY0YmMZJTM factor, the "iZEiP" and "ez[RDJxx" level occured four times as often as the ";it" and "giO" level. The "giO" level occured three times as often as the ";it" level. The ijn&HvqnYiIX6* factor consists of four levels: "kYRAC", "byE", "nrdAgsrbp", and "ZgS". In the ijn&HvqnYiIX6* factor, the "kYRAC" level occured five times as often as the "byE", "nrdAgsrbp", and "ZgS" level. The CgcZmD&XulWR factor consists of four levels: "GBBDPF{", "1qrc}SDy", "WwjzBxQ:LoX>*", and "MDgDiSdRJAJcMW". In the CgcZmD&XulWR factor, the "MDgDiSdRJAJcMW" level occured twice as often as the "GBBDPF{", "1qrc}SDy", and "WwjzBxQ:LoX>*" level.
