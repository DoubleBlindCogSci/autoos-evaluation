There are three regular factors: JPEeK bkk, FYdEXnj_hvR0, and AmUdvwcYmOEu. The JPEeK bkk factor consists of five levels: "xekdk!qo1KXd", "uoRn", "]s;LlOhKDh4nO", "dg[KbbqeYb", and "JOPDSRc". In the JPEeK bkk factor, the "dg[KbbqeYb" level occured six times as often as the other levels. The FYdEXnj_hvR0 factor consists of five levels: "lvOntGk", "rPHWnDpjUUj", "yOX ", "w4Hraly8rOCOt", and "Jplf&syKU". In the FYdEXnj_hvR0 factor, the "lvOntGk" level occured three times as often as the other levels. The AmUdvwcYmOEu factor consists of six levels: "^ucgbDZUF8", "Wax*Rn", "jPrdx3>eh", "LCxxI[gA", "g]DoKdSY", and "UO>aKUuZXspP)F". In the AmUdvwcYmOEu factor, the "Wax*Rn" level occured six times as often as the other levels. The "g]DoKdSY" level occured seven times as often as the other levels.
