There is one regular factor: mR#oSR. The mR#oSR factor consists of eight levels: "Qcux", "mtnbsZU", "HTkhTRh>*GQn", "CAhqRP", "fpaeaYph[", "b@FCjC", "M8xlMpWVkYW]B", and "uv@Z*lKW>Sy". In the mR#oSR factor, the level "Qcux" occured three times as often as the levels "mtnbsZU", "HTkhTRh>*GQn", "fpaeaYph[", "b@FCjC", "M8xlMpWVkYW]B", and "uv@Z*lKW>Sy". The level "CAhqRP" occured six times as often as the levels "mtnbsZU", "HTkhTRh>*GQn", "fpaeaYph[", "b@FCjC", "M8xlMpWVkYW]B", and "uv@Z*lKW>Sy". The level "uv@Z*lKW>Sy" occured eight times as often as the levels "mtnbsZU", "HTkhTRh>*GQn", "fpaeaYph[", "b@FCjC", "M8xlMpWVkYW]B", and "uv@Z*lKW>Sy".
