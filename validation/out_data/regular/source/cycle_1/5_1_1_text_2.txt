There is one regular factor: DCL. The DCL factor consists of five levels: "lw7IVKnD$>", "k?>h#", "hat", "cf|>zm#BmRY%E", and "ei_uI39rKEyg". In the DCL factor, the level "k?>h#" occured nine times as often as the level "lw7IVKnD$>", "hat", "ei_uI39rKEyg". The level "cf|>zm#BmRY%E" occured five times as often as the level "lw7IVKnD$>", "hat", "ei_uI39rKEyg".
