There are two regular factors: OKJR!bFabtyQS and gRMzN. The OKJR!bFabtyQS factor consists of nine levels: "qCi~_UREBIb", "6|yfeAo6R8Wj$", "byvZcF", "owY[k", "isChMWrYBGRde", "_JJjeUFGh", "EtyrG", "aOyxW3|Vk:KB", and "w0u~W". In the OKJR!bFabtyQS factor, the level "byvZcF" occured twice as often as the level "owY[k". The gRMzN factor consists of eight levels: "tdc", "Jgu", "NdStEO::}qAYo", "XO12KQDACTWFC", ":Vt", "mnPru", "hIiVtGGQK7Ag", and "Wvx!nW". In the gRMzN factor, the level "Jgu" occured eight times as often as the level "tdc". The level "NdStEO::}qAYo" occured four times as often as the level "tdc". The level "mnPru" occured eight times as often as the level "tdc". The level "Wvx!nW" occured four times as often as the level "tdc".
