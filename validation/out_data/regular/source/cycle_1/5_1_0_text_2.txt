There is one regular factor: kzyW. The kzyW factor consists of six levels: "mQ30", "eL3ohDXn", ";CURDohH", "Z$Pnf^", "A]8NtVkkCZ", and "3rFK^E(vzT". In the kzyW factor, the level "mQ30" occured four times as often as the levels "eL3ohDXn", ";CURDohH", and "Z$Pnf^". The level "A]8NtVkkCZ" occured twice as often as the levels "eL3ohDXn", ";CURDohH", and "Z$Pnf^". The level "3rFK^E(vzT" occured seven times as often as the levels "eL3ohDXn", ";CURDohH", and "Z$Pnf^".
