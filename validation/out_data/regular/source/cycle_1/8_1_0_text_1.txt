There is one regular factor: z). The z) factor consists of ten levels: "Exg[AC?ZBF&G", "LffPu", "k{Bsw:", "z3o@a", ")gl", "mGH]feSN@E_wZ", "} SXCLk", "EpPGNSOMX|ID&", "w3JkLFy!ykO]". In the z) factor, the level "LffPu" occured three times as often as the level "Exg[AC?ZBF&G", "k{Bsw:", "z3o@a", ")gl", "mGH]feSN@E_wZ", "} SXCLk", "EpPGNSOMX|ID&". The level ")gl" occured four times as often as the level "Exg[AC?ZBF&G", "k{Bsw:", "z3o@a", "mGH]feSN@E_wZ", "} SXCLk", "EpPGNSOMX|ID&". The level "w3JkLFy!ykO]" occured eight times as often as the level "Exg[AC?ZBF&G", "k{Bsw:", "z3o@a", "mGH]feSN@E_wZ", "} SXCLk", "EpPGNSOMX|ID&".
