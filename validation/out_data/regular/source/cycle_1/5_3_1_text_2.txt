There are three regular factors: hDgQWaXpJJ6Z, wGgWr, and ynYzCPvL%mPs. The hDgQWaXpJJ6Z factor consists of five levels: "Zqh)C1x", "mt]IDVYR@UZH", "fMKmyzbf", "DELscRU#P|utl}", and "fC>DXcdXJQMjhm". In the hDgQWaXpJJ6Z factor, the "mt]IDVYR@UZH" level occured nine times as often as the "Zqh)C1x", "fMKmyzbf", "DELscRU#P|utl}" and "fC>DXcdXJQMjhm" level. The wGgWr factor consists of six levels: "SNL", "FSH", "cxlmR", "enWvs]SdPQfU", "FMyr_g3lEfn", and "pXBiAxc|". In the wGgWr factor, the "SNL" level occured nine times as often as the "FSH", "cxlmR", "enWvs]SdPQfU", "FMyr_g3lEfn", and "pXBiAxc|" level. The "enWvs]SdPQfU" level occured twice as often as the "FSH", "cxlmR", "FMyr_g3lEfn", and "pXBiAxc|" level. The "FMyr_g3lEfn" level occured ten times as often as the "FSH", "cxlmR", "enWvs]SdPQfU", and "pXBiAxc|" level. The ynYzCPvL%mPs factor consists of five levels: "dQstz?fp)Um", "CziVPGnK", "Kpt", "kyhQSeMg", and "jtcK". In the ynYzCPvL%mPs factor, the "kyhQSeMg" level occured four times as often as the "dQstz?fp)Um", "CziVPGnK", "Kpt", and "jtcK" level.
