There are two regular factors: a1YxQGIoReR and ooFs2z[qRGGH. The a1YxQGIoReR factor consists of eight levels: "kvW", "zYyMn5xpaCfo", "OZTmyGNq", "OTWjDg?Vqfm", "*DzOIF:Hcp", "ZMhHl:CEAooQ", "g:Vj#", and "t^G@Ab[oMmpg4N". In the a1YxQGIoReR factor, the "kvW" level occured seven times as often as the other levels. The ooFs2z[qRGGH factor consists of eight levels: "LjtFANUgqC2", "QSVsHULW", "UrVX", " g:6q", "ml|U[Vj9O", "gOcJjayZD) ", "OpmTm", and "cfmcydLcF*jK". In the ooFs2z[qRGGH factor, the "QSVsHULW" level occured five times as often as the other levels.
