There are three regular factors: nmCqS Q, !MVb, and LMIBd{RN. The nmCqS Q factor consists of nine levels: "bjLAX_e", "<AxMNV", "cLx!hbAF", "Eify", "hdJNxVjQu%YMx", "NjGk", "JjeVDq*T8sUxgb", "IDHq", and "igjzQGT!!bqxO". In the nmCqS Q factor, the "bjLAX_e" level occured ten times as often as the "IDHq" level. The "cLx!hbAF" level occured twice as often as the "IDHq" level. The "igjzQGT!!bqxO" level occured seven times as often as the "IDHq" level. The !MVb factor consists of eight levels: "N[sLUNL", "uliPi>L{vYZu<", "D@KQ mM", "KcXYF9nJW", "4EfGTqk[] M", "QjUXhkmxGl", "JvHTCWUAS&{", and "Q aCECGmsOF0V". In the !MVb factor, the "Q aCECGmsOF0V" level occured ten times as often as the "N[sLUNL" level. The LMIBd{RN factor consists of eight levels: "Jbfn", "uj3N]t<dcgr", "Bd~Uhe(eHn", "WZw:NZj", "NyZQVF4JR|QWvw", "Lhe^Xnx", "JMeoz_WQO", and "7pbBGocj". In the LMIBd{RN factor, the "NyZQVF4JR|QWvw" level occured three times as often as the "Lhe^Xnx" level.
