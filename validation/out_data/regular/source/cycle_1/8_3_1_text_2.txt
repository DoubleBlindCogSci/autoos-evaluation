There are two regular factors: OKJR!bFabtyQS and gRMzN. The OKJR!bFabtyQS factor consists of nine levels: "qCi~_UREBIb", "6|yfeAo6R8Wj$", "byvZcF", "owY[k", "isChMWrYBGRde", "_JJjeUFGh", "EtyrG", "aOyxW3|Vk:KB", and "w0u~W". In the OKJR!bFabtyQS factor, the "byvZcF" level occured twice as often as the other levels. The gRMzN factor consists of eight levels: "tdc", "Jgu", "NdStEO::}qAYo", "XO12KQDACTWFC", ":Vt", "mnPru", "hIiVtGGQK7Ag", and "Wvx!nW". In the gRMzN factor, the "Jgu" and "mnPru" levels occured eight times as often as the other levels. The "NdStEO::}qAYo" and "Wvx!nW" levels occured four times as often as the other levels.
