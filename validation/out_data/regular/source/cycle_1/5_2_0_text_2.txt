There are two regular factors: aFFrDTJF~ and KJgiTHr7lW. The aFFrDTJF~ factor consists of five levels: "NCeyfqWILr5RzI", "YH%njwHgJe", "pPr08Ddvqy", "DM?fq Bzq", and "DpD|IK Boe". In the aFFrDTJF~ factor, the "YH%njwHgJe" level occured five times as often as the "NCeyfqWILr5RzI", "pPr08Ddvqy", "DM?fq Bzq", and "DpD|IK Boe" level. The KJgiTHr7lW factor consists of five levels: "}LY", "chk>mOUZsDPlO", "]~@FmCBJsA", "RUDwvZ?", and "AQ}RRYJf2)<Uje". In the KJgiTHr7lW factor, the "}LY", "chk>mOUZsDPlO", "]~@FmCBJsA", and "RUDwvZ?" level occured in the ratio 1:3:8:8.
