There are three regular factors: _HAzv, RabtMGmqX, and LFsvlDVeGo$. The _HAzv factor consists of ten levels: "gr&GSlM", "9xdOnDHGXf", "UNOTTFk)AFMq0", "U1*mng J", "BZysJvDInew", "FSHhEAThvq4", "{{BS", "FtPqFz", and "AdpSV|TDjYLoN". The RabtMGmqX factor consists of nine levels: "ZgGspLf nfkGor", "*FChWzjw", "L}d", "QhJJMKxIbjFcEk", "uWf;kYbym#JIk", "CGC", "Mvd", "kMHQP", and "{u3K EaIG". In the RabtMGmqX factor, the level "ZgGspLf nfkGor" occured nine times as often as the levels "*FChWzjw", "L}d", "QhJJMKxIbjFcEk", "CGC", "Mvd", "kMHQP", and "{u3K EaIG". The level "uWf;kYbym#JIk" occured four times as often as the levels "*FChWzjw", "L}d", "QhJJMKxIbjFcEk", "CGC", "Mvd", "kMHQP", and "{u3K EaIG". The level "kMHQP" occured three times as often as the levels "*FChWzjw", "L}d", "QhJJMKxIbjFcEk", "CGC", "Mvd", and "{u3K EaIG". The level "{u3K EaIG" occured three times as often as the levels "*FChWzjw", "L}d", "QhJJMKxIbjFcEk", "CGC", "Mvd", and "kMHQP". The LFsvlDVeGo$ factor consists of nine levels: "DSVIcFpZBQZ", "utGw", "EZWxy>hD6h", "uzZQFDKw]WIe", "OxkwKnHt?", "rW>S&p", "Y1TaFMKq tRA", "bDJVif", and "G7~sZf VBE$r". In the LFsvlDVeGo$ factor, the level "EZWxy>hD6h" occured three times as often as the levels "DSVIcFpZBQZ", "utGw", "uzZQFDKw]WIe", "OxkwKnHt?", "rW>S&p", "Y1TaFMKq tRA", "bDJVif", and "G7~sZf VBE$r". The level "G7~sZf VBE$r" occured five times as often as the levels "DSVIcFpZBQZ", "utGw", "uzZQFDKw]WIe", "OxkwKnHt?", "rW>S&p", "Y1TaFMKq tRA", and "bDJVif".
