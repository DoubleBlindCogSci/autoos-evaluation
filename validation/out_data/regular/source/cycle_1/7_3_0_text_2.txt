There are three regular factors: l>HDHBWxR, uBKrQeGEhYKrb, and NcIdaI. The l>HDHBWxR factor consists of eight levels: "Ls(t", "sTUiO3eXcy^I", "at*(bs9jDinb", "XuHVRnZAkHn", "WTayEPxExi^", "Nnrp!n&dQJ", "qUwDOPNIMCJ", and " XmHk1". In the l>HDHBWxR factor, the level "Nnrp!n&dQJ" occured eight times as often as the levels "Ls(t", "sTUiO3eXcy^I", "at*(bs9jDinb", "XuHVRnZAkHn", "WTayEPxExi^", "qUwDOPNIMCJ", and " XmHk1". The level " XmHk1" occured nine times as often as the levels "Ls(t", "sTUiO3eXcy^I", "at*(bs9jDinb", "XuHVRnZAkHn", "WTayEPxExi^", "qUwDOPNIMCJ", and " XmHk1". The uBKrQeGEhYKrb factor consists of eight levels: "14KKMYqM", "afw", "jcQiT", "vRe", "OvVrLC", "Ka Le", "vgwJ", and "%zQxUl}YWtoB". In the uBKrQeGEhYKrb factor, the level "jcQiT" occured ten times as often as the levels "14KKMYqM", "afw", "vRe", "OvVrLC", "Ka Le", "vgwJ", and "%zQxUl}YWtoB". The NcIdaI factor consists of seven levels: "TtS9fTWcz>I", "bJbuVL", "CxIbZLCmEiy", "V uDd^vq", "G_yvV)5", "}LI^jmZ:!}s", and "u&gvyt". In the NcIdaI factor, the level "CxIbZLCmEiy" occured eight times as often as the levels "TtS9fTWcz>I", "bJbuVL", "V uDd^vq", "G_yvV)5", "}LI^jmZ:!}s", and "u&gvyt". The level "}LI^jmZ:!}s" occured four times as often as the levels "TtS9fTWcz>I", "bJbuVL", "V uDd^vq", "G_yvV)5", and "u&gvyt".
