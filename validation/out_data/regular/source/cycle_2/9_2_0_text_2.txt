There are two regular factors: VXgn and gzlpiy. The VXgn factor consists of ten levels: "pFuROZI", "AL:Rm", "H%ezN>9cIA8Z", "C4dy", "KAEiGsZv!gDEqx", "KRsuNgOkEA", "h<XqmUzks ko", "qD7", "gZSo", and "AIJTUuUnYi#7q". In the VXgn factor, the "pFuROZI" level occured ten times as often as the "AL:Rm", "H%ezN>9cIA8Z", "KAEiGsZv!gDEqx", "h<XqmUzks ko", "gZSo" and "AIJTUuUnYi#7q" level. The "C4dy" level occured five times as often as the "AL:Rm", "H%ezN>9cIA8Z", "KAEiGsZv!gDEqx", "h<XqmUzks ko", "gZSo" and "AIJTUuUnYi#7q" level. The "KRsuNgOkEA" level occured eight times as often as the "AL:Rm", "H%ezN>9cIA8Z", "KAEiGsZv!gDEqx", "h<XqmUzks ko", "gZSo" and "AIJTUuUnYi#7q" level. The "qD7" level occured nine times as often as the "AL:Rm", "H%ezN>9cIA8Z", "KAEiGsZv!gDEqx", "h<XqmUzks ko", "gZSo" and "AIJTUuUnYi#7q" level. The gzlpiy factor consists of nine levels: "sNRD^CUTY", "PyDkyB5H(x@", "AlW", "p tewt", "AS@MZGGvJDCgs", "pw!", "F#igtIMhgbzrwi", "gjn:S", and "vb_EeQVca]j". In the gzlpiy factor, the "sNRD^CUTY" level occured twice as often as the "PyDkyB5H(x@", "AlW", "p tewt", "AS@MZGGvJDCgs", "pw!", "F#igtIMhgbzrwi", "vb_EeQVca]j" level. The "gjn:S" level occured nine times as often as the "PyDkyB5H(x@", "AlW", "p tewt", "AS@MZGGvJDCgs", "pw!", "F#igtIMhgbzrwi", "vb_EeQVca]j" level.
