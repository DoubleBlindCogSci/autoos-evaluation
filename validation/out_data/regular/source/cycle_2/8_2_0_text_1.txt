There are two regular factors: 6nMFHmg and RryaCHD<QG. The 6nMFHmg factor consists of eight levels: "U RPg", "U>eAy", "nMBLBD", "TFPr7Azswr", "deEUu", "hqp", "%ZoTnVTIe&", and "M:z]GH". In the 6nMFHmg factor, the level "U>eAy" occured nine times as often as the level "U RPg". The level "nMBLBD" occured six times as often as the level "U RPg". The RryaCHD<QG factor consists of eight levels: "lqAK4QobG_zBVR", "isRd", "PNm", "BMMmNTpyMD", "}dzpC8", "i$Nm", "BMPhQNUw", and "DGIUu}". In the RryaCHD<QG factor, the level "lqAK4QobG_zBVR" occured twice as often as the level "isRd". The level "PNm" occured twice as often as the level "isRd". The level "BMPhQNUw" occured eight times as often as the level "isRd".
