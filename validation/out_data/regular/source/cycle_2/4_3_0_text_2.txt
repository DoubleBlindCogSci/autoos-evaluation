There are three regular factors: ZPWrVc, eqGmUptsi, and v}Vy. The ZPWrVc factor consists of four levels: "CNgNhGHCCZHip", "kFEKuvBWnTg?3c", "YtThQKPVniM~", and "Aq#{UhDtH". In the ZPWrVc factor, the "CNgNhGHCCZHip" level occured ten times as often as the "kFEKuvBWnTg?3c" level. The "YtThQKPVniM~" level occured eight times as often as the "kFEKuvBWnTg?3c" level. The eqGmUptsi factor consists of five levels: "oC7Sfpibdy", "VQPBA", "tJRJlVUb~yL", "VNZNo0p", and "RBL5P?dedH". In the eqGmUptsi factor, the "tJRJlVUb~yL" level occured seven times as often as the "oC7Sfpibdy", "VQPBA", "VNZNo0p", and "RBL5P?dedH" level. The v}Vy factor consists of four levels: "2hy>", "MHU", "UwsYZMnPe", and "ZMLL#T". In the v}Vy factor, the "UwsYZMnPe" level occured four times as often as the "2hy>", "MHU", and "ZMLL#T" level. The "ZMLL#T" level occured twice as often as the "2hy>", "MHU", and "ZMLL#T" level.
