There are three regular factors: ijDRyQgxkUTaL, fCdWJg[agY4t, and bby<IGB. The ijDRyQgxkUTaL factor consists of seven levels: "TlK(U", "ILnBfN", "YlGhk{rRndt", "m#zU4$yXzyY", "xP(Kgw", "nlSTn2ltc^dA". In the ijDRyQgxkUTaL factor, the level "ILnBfN" occured four times as often as the level "TlK(U". The fCdWJg[agY4t factor consists of seven levels: "X^y", "SsGnoU", "HuylBEsNI", "aDZ?kDGeN", "4rK", "Rs5HmgAl%1ze", "sZlUeBAUd4B". In the fCdWJg[agY4t factor, the level "HuylBEsNI" occured three times as often as the level "X^y". The bby<IGB factor consists of six levels: "VuhAlkZJuMGo", "M_vZsRG", "XTyslcxc4;DvGU", "sG*iqB", "dni{DyCPDp", "GnXo". In the bby<IGB factor, the level "M_vZsRG" occured twice as often as the level "VuhAlkZJuMGo".
