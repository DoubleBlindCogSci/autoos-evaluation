There are two regular factors: 6nMFHmg and RryaCHD<QG. The 6nMFHmg factor consists of eight levels: "U RPg", "U>eAy", "nMBLBD", "TFPr7Azswr", "deEUu", "hqp", "%ZoTnVTIe&", and "M:z]GH". In the 6nMFHmg factor, the "U RPg" level occured once as often as the "U>eAy" level. The "nMBLBD" level occured six times as often as the "U>eAy" level. The RryaCHD<QG factor consists of eight levels: "lqAK4QobG_zBVR", "isRd", "PNm", "BMMmNTpyMD", "}dzpC8", "i$Nm", "BMPhQNUw", and "DGIUu}". In the RryaCHD<QG factor, the "lqAK4QobG_zBVR" level occured twice as often as the "isRd" level. The "PNm" level occured twice as often as the "isRd" level. The "BMPhQNUw" level occured eight times as often as the "isRd" level.
