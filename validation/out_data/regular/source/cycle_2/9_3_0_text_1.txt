There are three regular factors: vTJkanPU, }XW)EkRXPUsH7E, and utDl#. The vTJkanPU factor consists of ten levels: "VDs", "MFD6j3?EYi6NFh", "!zPTtyn%co", "gH|iRf", "vFVSSFIAzt", "5gUmG acaXL", "Nrvr", "bvbIM", "im_REOCUXNxC", and "FcNn". In the vTJkanPU factor, the level "gH|iRf" occured nine times as often as the level "Nrvr". The level "bvbIM" occured six times as often as the level "Nrvr". The level "im_REOCUXNxC" occured four times as often as the level "Nrvr". The }XW)EkRXPUsH7E factor consists of nine levels: "yb@2Il:MSwMzm", "ze(x&ObX", "YM%j6wJBxNu", "Ll@FKdGT6bDX", "bmap", "TMaZm@GCy", "du%8kP?YfvAkG", "hsmp5qaZxq", "mzX". In the }XW)EkRXPUsH7E factor, the level "yb@2Il:MSwMzm" occured seven times as often as the level "bmap" or the level "mzX". The utDl# factor consists of ten levels: "WHfo_WErI", "BsKTj!GBwvsNP", "d<C]", "h5eFN_a", "fP#XIA~eQf[ulf", "IJjFXxlODf", "yQ&Pf8jMZRbfM", "pZ$mJS", "hcm(nSeI;A", "TNw2dblAjLMWtD". In the utDl# factor, the level "yQ&Pf8jMZRbfM" occured nine times as often as the level "pZ$mJS". The level "WHfo_WErI" occured four times as often as the level "pZ$mJS".
