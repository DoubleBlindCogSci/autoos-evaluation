There are two regular factors: VXgn and gzlpiy. The VXgn factor consists of ten levels: "pFuROZI", "AL:Rm", "H%ezN>9cIA8Z", "C4dy", "KAEiGsZv!gDEqx", "KRsuNgOkEA", "h<XqmUzks ko", "qD7", "gZSo", and "AIJTUuUnYi#7q". In the VXgn factor, the level "pFuROZI" occured ten times as often as the level "AL:Rm" or the level "H%ezN>9cIA8Z". The level "C4dy" occured five times as often as the level "AL:Rm" or the level "H%ezN>9cIA8Z". The level "KRsuNgOkEA" occured eight times as often as the level "AL:Rm" or the level "H%ezN>9cIA8Z". The level "qD7" occured nine times as often as the level "AL:Rm" or the level "H%ezN>9cIA8Z". The level "AIJTUuUnYi#7q" occured ten times as often as the level "AL:Rm" or the level "H%ezN>9cIA8Z". The gzlpiy factor consists of nine levels: "sNRD^CUTY", "PyDkyB5H(x@", "AlW", "p tewt", "AS@MZGGvJDCgs", "pw!", "F#igtIMhgbzrwi", "gjn:S", and "vb_EeQVca]j". In the gzlpiy factor, the level "sNRD^CUTY" occured twice as often as the level "PyDkyB5H(x@" or the level "AlW". The level "F#igtIMhgbzrwi" occured once as often as the level "PyDkyB5H(x@" or the level "AlW". The level "gjn:S" occured nine times as often as the level "PyDkyB5H(x@" or the level "AlW".
