There is one regular factor: bKCN. The bKCN factor consists of six levels: ":NUysnqtG{iRn(", "bVTtnrnteksEr", "ySkzbupsM", "fOS", "3bbnhcbE", and "bzRkSJ". In the bKCN factor, the level ":NUysnqtG{iRn(" occured ten times as often as the level "bVTtnrnteksEr". The level "bVTtnrnteksEr" occured six times as often as the level "ySkzbupsM". The level "ySkzbupsM" occured four times as often as the level "fOS". The level "fOS" occured three times as often as the level "3bbnhcbE" or "bzRkSJ".
