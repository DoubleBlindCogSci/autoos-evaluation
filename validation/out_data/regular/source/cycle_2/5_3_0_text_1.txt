There are three regular factors: FcUlGzASLNKP(v, aG9iGruiEpi, and b]arlTT. The FcUlGzASLNKP(v factor consists of five levels: Zo$b<?LHZYsw, BERk[mgcl, mcmW!~OZqd, RHkFRhKFB, and tdHW#Ug7mCJTF. In the FcUlGzASLNKP(v factor, the Zo$b<?LHZYsw level occured seven times as often as the BERk[mgcl level. The mcmW!~OZqd level occured eight times as often as the BERk[mgcl level. The RHkFRhKFB level occured two times as often as the BERk[mgcl level. The aG9iGruiEpi factor consists of five levels: { 1N, eNhfUe MH4gx, W:L#SLKyD df, HU0PWfKY|), and qiRL. In the aG9iGruiEpi factor, the HU0PWfKY|) level occured ten times as often as the { 1N, eNhfUe MH4gx, W:L#SLKyD df, and qiRL levels. The b]arlTT factor consists of five levels: hR%q, 9Os_, 5U|SQ, Gxu, and fnaZmSKA6. In the b]arlTT factor, the hR%q level occured three times as often as the 9Os_ level. The Gxu level occured five times as often as the 9Os_ level.
