There are two regular factors: T$dsoWn and eS?i. The T$dsoWn factor consists of two levels: "VUlOnKNLYpW^" and ";SsnEj". In the T$dsoWn factor, the "VUlOnKNLYpW^" level occured five times as often as the ";SsnEj" level. The eS?i factor also consists of two levels: "OxKNQLt" and "oZyMeSzICp". In the eS?i factor, the "OxKNQLt" level occured once as often as the "oZyMeSzICp" level.
