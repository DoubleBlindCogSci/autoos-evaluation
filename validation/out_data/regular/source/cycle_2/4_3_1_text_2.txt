There are three regular factors: UVq[fEbnWkk, P3WfL]UX>iOyf, and cuuvWqk (x)RA. The UVq[fEbnWkk factor consists of four levels: "KiLzF", "tiYQydlil>", "I13", and "QMoi@D". In the UVq[fEbnWkk factor, the "KiLzF" level occured five times as often as the "tiYQydlil>" or "I13" level. The "QMoi@D" level occured seven times as often as the "tiYQydlil>" or "I13" level. The P3WfL]UX>iOyf factor consists of four levels: "DpD*VprHYcl", "#Si!7ZG", "dagYxP", and "AmTaWIpRQ". The cuuvWqk (x)RA factor consists of four levels: "ZTaZOVVLK", "IZ8", "3bB%KC3xHUf", and "WSG;T>D5af{D4B". In the cuuvWqk (x)RA factor, the "ZTaZOVVLK" level occured once as often as the "IZ8" level. The "3bB%KC3xHUf" level occured three times as often as the "IZ8" level. The "WSG;T>D5af{D4B" level occured once as often as the "IZ8" level.
