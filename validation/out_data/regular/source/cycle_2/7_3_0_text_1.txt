There are three regular factors: N6Bn, hfm_3, and uPdZ<ygZP. The N6Bn factor consists of eight levels: "Ldm", "chrUvnM|ZQvCS", "j<QkW", ">4lT7", "vZHr", "K2ghss<YwE[Q", "Y8aTbwKWnph", and "mrJ". In the N6Bn factor, the "Ldm" level occured four times as often as the "chrUvnM|ZQvCS", "j<QkW", ">4lT7", "vZHr", "K2ghss<YwE[Q", "Y8aTbwKWnph" level. The "mrJ" level occured nine times as often as the "chrUvnM|ZQvCS", "j<QkW", ">4lT7", "vZHr", "K2ghss<YwE[Q", "Y8aTbwKWnph" level. The hfm_3 factor consists of seven levels: "fsEF", " pUWH", "OTUOppP;VCi", "hdurS", "ISuXvoVCPDP", "Qu2", and "#K#F}dLXUh&RI". In the hfm_3 factor, the "fsEF" level occured six times as often as the " pUWH", "OTUOppP;VCi", "hdurS", "ISuXvoVCPDP", "Qu2", and "#K#F}dLXUh&RI" level. The "OTUOppP;VCi" level occured three times as often as the " pUWH", "hdurS", "ISuXvoVCPDP", "Qu2", and "#K#F}dLXUh&RI" level. The "ISuXvoVCPDP" level occured nine times as often as the " pUWH", "hdurS", "OTUOppP;VCi", "Qu2", and "#K#F}dLXUh&RI" level. The "Qu2" level occured two times as often as the " pUWH", "hdurS", "OTUOppP;VCi", "ISuXvoVCPDP", and "#K#F}dLXUh&RI" level. The uPdZ<ygZP factor consists of eight levels: "MFdi8MQhP[G", "UijZHGvx", "fltZe^8IxXIR", "b(b7OhdQPuFKE", "HOX6XppTGg", "saLs{Ze8Bu$ ", "os>jNIjMK", and "8SOhj[hhC". In the uPdZ<ygZP factor, the "fltZe^8IxXIR" level occured two times as often as the "MFdi8MQhP[G", "UijZHGvx", "b(b7OhdQPuFKE", "HOX6XppTGg", "saLs{Ze8Bu$ ", "os>jNIjMK", and "8SOhj[hhC" level.
