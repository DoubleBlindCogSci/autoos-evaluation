There is one regular factor: bKCN. The bKCN factor consists of the six letters: "3bbnhcbE", ":NUysnqtG{iRn(", "bVTtnrnteksEr", "bzRkSJ", "ySkzbupsM", and "fOS". In the bKCN factor, the level ":NUysnqtG{iRn(" appeared ten times as often as the level "3bbnhcbE", "bVTtnrnteksEr", "bzRkSJ", "ySkzbupsM", and "fOS". The level "bVTtnrnteksEr" appeared six times as often as the level "3bbnhcbE", "bzRkSJ", "ySkzbupsM", and "fOS". The level "ySkzbupsM" appeared four times as often as the level "3bbnhcbE", "bzRkSJ", and "fOS". The level "fOS" appeared three times as often as the level "3bbnhcbE" and "bzRkSJ".
