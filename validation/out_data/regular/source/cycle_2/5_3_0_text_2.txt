There are three regular factors: FcUlGzASLNKP(v, aG9iGruiEpi, and b]arlTT. The FcUlGzASLNKP(v factor consists of five levels: "Zo$b<?LHZYsw", "BERk[mgcl", "mcmW!~OZqd", "RHkFRhKFB", and "tdHW#Ug7mCJTF". In the FcUlGzASLNKP(v factor, the "Zo$b<?LHZYsw" level occured seven times as often as the "BERk[mgcl" level. The "mcmW!~OZqd" level occured eight times as often as the "BERk[mgcl" level. The "RHkFRhKFB" level occured twice as often as the "BERk[mgcl" level. The "tdHW#Ug7mCJTF" level occured once as often as the "BERk[mgcl" level. The aG9iGruiEpi factor consists of three levels: "{ 1N, eNhfUe MH4gx, W:L#SLKyD df", "HU0PWfKY|)", and "qiRL". In the aG9iGruiEpi factor, the "HU0PWfKY|)" level occured ten times as often as the "{ 1N, eNhfUe MH4gx, W:L#SLKyD df" level. The b]arlTT factor consists of five levels: "hR%q", "9Os_", "5U|SQ", "Gxu", and "fnaZmSKA6". In the b]arlTT factor, the "Gxu" level occured five times as often as the "hR%q" level.
