There are two regular factors: cBEra and yX>wc. The cBEra factor consists of three levels: "uEQEp", "zngvOgjInkCCe", and "TbrhwXKm:QrEsR". The yX>wc factor consists of four levels: "XYf&f gEMX1", "aZXs", "jQKqc", and "X|G(". In the yX>wc factor, the level "X|G(" occured twice as often as the levels "XYf&f gEMX1", "aZXs", and "jQKqc".
