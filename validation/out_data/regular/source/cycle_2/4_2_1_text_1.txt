There are two regular factors: fiFAZYEF7 and K MYI4SMfSMnLr. The fiFAZYEF7 factor consists of four levels: "n;u{", "}JStvuEbR", "ZVM", and "Oq z^{KPRkVf". In the fiFAZYEF7 factor, the "n;u{" level occured ten times as often as the "}JStvuEbR" level. The "ZVM" level occured three times as often as the "}JStvuEbR" level. The K MYI4SMfSMnLr factor consists of four levels: "YyV~klXy!K8Xf", "G[N%:vgGnTw", "yXrWqW}4[", and "|Pj". In the K MYI4SMfSMnLr factor, the "YyV~klXy!K8Xf" level occured five times as often as the "G[N%:vgGnTw" level.
