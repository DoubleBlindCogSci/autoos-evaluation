In the Nu9hsR7)QRVyT factor, the level "?ZBCNvSe" occured six times as often as the other levels. The W!cIisM8FtnMmD factor consists of eight levels: "~BBHICUcD", "kScn0s", "KypU", "<VVbyuZ4or", "BAfAY@ct)KUy", "ckxe3", "BfZFF", and "ZKiVYkip". In the W!cIisM8FtnMmD factor, the level "~BBHICUcD" occured seven times as often as the other levels. The level "<VVbyuZ4or" occured six times as often as the other levels.
