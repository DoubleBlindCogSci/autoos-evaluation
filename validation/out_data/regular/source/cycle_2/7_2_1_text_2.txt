There are two regular factors: MP7FzIHmqdW and RBx. The MP7FzIHmqdW factor consists of seven levels: "{vrGALh#w", "O8RV)rv{Vh", "AT[w", "!lIwNNNzZhXSE", "byA^d<jnV", "4NMpPWsLpj", and "ap~)y7bFUm!)". In the MP7FzIHmqdW factor, the level "{vrGALh#w" occured seven times as often as the levels "O8RV)rv{Vh", "AT[w", "!lIwNNNzZhXSE", "byA^d<jnV", "4NMpPWsLpj", and "ap~)y7bFUm!)". The RBx factor consists of nine levels: "Z4QEwqb", "Q)HnCEu5I", "d3nmjAaP", "XPtVlLK2gKCrj", "5S*MThl og>jN", "fREIS5qcowiSjA", "YbWiXA", "Ko>0W", and "TlZM". In the RBx factor, the level "XPtVlLK2gKCrj" occured ten times as often as the levels "Z4QEwqb", "Q)HnCEu5I", "d3nmjAaP", "5S*MThl og>jN", "fREIS5qcowiSjA", "YbWiXA", "Ko>0W", and "TlZM".
