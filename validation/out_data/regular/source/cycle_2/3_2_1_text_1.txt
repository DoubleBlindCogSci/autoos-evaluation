There are two regular factors: UN _V[2fs and F9Q>XrOfyoLdMm. The UN _V[2fs factor consists of three levels: "lyOOD[0U>uxX", "QSOx9Ljaxj", and "kSg". In the UN _V[2fs factor, the "lyOOD[0U>uxX" level occured three times as often as the "QSOx9Ljaxj" level. The F9Q>XrOfyoLdMm factor consists of three levels: "EpXmH", "JlQX9", and "R1#V". In the F9Q>XrOfyoLdMm factor, the "EpXmH" level occured ten times as often as the "JlQX9" level. The "R1#V" level occured eight times as often as the "JlQX9" level.
