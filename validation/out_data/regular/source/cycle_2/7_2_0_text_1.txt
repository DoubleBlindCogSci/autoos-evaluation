There are two regular factors: ZTTKcHt<I and bC@X. The ZTTKcHt<I factor consists of eight levels: "OS|yv{[UpvDa", "UMWKNHvJdD", "LzSMH", "0fo", "$JU]GUA", "vJYW", "CsdovqHpChLd", and "gSgOSIT". In the ZTTKcHt<I factor, the "OS|yv{[UpvDa" level occured nine times as often as the "UMWKNHvJdD", "LzSMH", "0fo", "$JU]GUA", "vJYW", "CsdovqHpChLd", and "gSgOSIT" levels. The bC@X factor consists of eight levels: "tNfwIuKYoqvIFJ", "RtrQVwWj(pUY[", "aHoK7P", "JYtSUk", "thgDE]Jp", "Mcd xm3e}B", "MrrRen$acYzgHf", and "CuELFAwb". In the bC@X factor, the "tNfwIuKYoqvIFJ" level occured nine times as often as the "RtrQVwWj(pUY[", "aHoK7P", "JYtSUk", "thgDE]Jp", "Mcd xm3e}B", "MrrRen$acYzgHf", and "CuELFAwb" levels.
