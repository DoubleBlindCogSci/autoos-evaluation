There are two regular factors: W4MTKU~&WBN and NvR?6@FrEbD. The W4MTKU~&WBN factor consists of five levels: "WoGI;cWf", "cybb", "cJeCRLrkOBQ", "tmsC4J;S", and "Yiv3rpTs[nX@Ay". In the W4MTKU~&WBN factor, the "WoGI;cWf" level occured seven times as often as the "cybb", "cJeCRLrkOBQ", "tmsC4J;S", and "Yiv3rpTs[nX@Ay" level. The "tmsC4J;S" level occured twice as often as the "cybb", "cJeCRLrkOBQ", and "Yiv3rpTs[nX@Ay" level. The NvR?6@FrEbD factor consists of four levels: "tsNCPlUL?", "bBQHegf", "%KvACU", and "lYOcU". In the NvR?6@FrEbD factor, the "bBQHegf" level occured six times as often as the "tsNCPlUL?", "%KvACU", and "lYOcU" level.
