There is one regular factor: ZbaD. The ZbaD factor consists of nine levels: "jhCRI)YIX", "GLuI", "mLFWURTN4pNq", "KgcuDbbXobSPwu", "vYNuY}CJPxNTli", "dFJ[tHB", "HukXRhVF", "xthWfHGq", and "EkUmun(kp". In the ZbaD factor, the level "mLFWURTN4pNq" occured five times as often as the levels "jhCRI)YIX", "GLuI", "KgcuDbbXobSPwu", "dFJ[tHB", "HukXRhVF", "xthWfHGq", and "EkUmun(kp". The level "vYNuY}CJPxNTli" occured six times as often as the levels "jhCRI)YIX", "GLuI", "KgcuDbbXobSPwu", "dFJ[tHB", "HukXRhVF", "xthWfHGq", and "EkUmun(kp".
