There is one regular factor: vcDqYA. The vcDqYA factor consists of six levels: "t9NFiQW", "4RXZQDRZfCv", "nTAJgZf1j Oodu", " jxZVEIfnqjd", "khFQQyN<%Cye", and "2naux". In the vcDqYA factor, the level "4RXZQDRZfCv" occured five times as often as the levels "t9NFiQW", "nTAJgZf1j Oodu", " jxZVEIfnqjd", "khFQQyN<%Cye", and "2naux". The level "khFQQyN<%Cye" occured twice as often as the levels "t9NFiQW", "nTAJgZf1j Oodu", " jxZVEIfnqjd", and "2naux".
