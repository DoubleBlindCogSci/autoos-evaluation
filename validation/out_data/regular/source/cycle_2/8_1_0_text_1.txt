There is one regular factor: U0CWjYXT~xv. The U0CWjYXT~xv factor consists of nine levels: "t$N@UYjUe!", "ISEvByPGf", "lepI?EB[$AvTc", "EEcurcEwyyAIAO", "isCI", "{kFp4ZKurdWJ", "^c5~xvuCTJYu", "HZ0", and "MpAWIbWNMMnV". In the U0CWjYXT~xv factor, the level "lepI?EB[$AvTc" occured four times as often as the level "t$N@UYjUe!", "ISEvByPGf", "EEcurcEwyyAIAO", "isCI", "{kFp4ZKurdWJ", "^c5~xvuCTJYu", "HZ0", and "MpAWIbWNMMnV". The level "^c5~xvuCTJYu" occured seven times as often as the level "t$N@UYjUe!", "ISEvByPGf", "EEcurcEwyyAIAO", "isCI", "{kFp4ZKurdWJ", "HZ0", and "MpAWIbWNMMnV".
