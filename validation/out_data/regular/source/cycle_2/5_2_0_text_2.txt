There are two regular factors: IRFBTnR and TPlnvC*. The IRFBTnR factor consists of seven levels: "IQJL", "3&h)AV", "UUHMmNSxl", "qrFthpS|tVeHWJ", "GGI5Fea", "kTSZa?Gz", and "dXEpv#xE[inoJd". In the IRFBTnR factor, the "IQJL" level occured ten times as often as the "3&h)AV", "UUHMmNSxl", "GGI5Fea", "kTSZa?Gz" and "dXEpv#xE[inoJd" levels. The "qrFthpS|tVeHWJ" level occured six times as often as the "3&h)AV", "UUHMmNSxl", "GGI5Fea", "kTSZa?Gz" and "dXEpv#xE[inoJd" levels. The TPlnvC* factor consists of five levels: "zP%yvoiE?Bv)y", "cS&ThNN", "vPZpS", "qcZYKB", and "RYc". In the TPlnvC* factor, the "cS&ThNN" and "qcZYKB" levels occured six times as often as the "zP%yvoiE?Bv)y", "vPZpS", and "RYc" levels.
