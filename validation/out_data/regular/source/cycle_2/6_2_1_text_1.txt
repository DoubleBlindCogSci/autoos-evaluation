There are two regular factors: ]kT and t toElWzUOfkCN. The ]kT factor consists of six levels: "gfno%S!y", "5Ex!Si", "SFuS$^dox]O", "JNM", "FXgs9U;xQ", and "cpxjNiurae_P". The t toElWzUOfkCN factor consists of six levels: "XDQm", "8*b2", "OVk6EQh", "{<T_aIYLJQO", "mSb0", and "&ftzV". In the t toElWzUOfkCN factor, the level "XDQm" occured seven times as often as the levels "8*b2", "OVk6EQh", "{<T_aIYLJQO", "mSb0", and "&ftzV". The level "&ftzV" occured four times as often as the levels "8*b2", "OVk6EQh", "{<T_aIYLJQO", and "mSb0".
