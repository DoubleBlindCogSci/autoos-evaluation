There are three regular factors: ZjRrH?, Ql9PKY, and VWCMH?L. The ZjRrH? factor consists of five levels: "YzORK#Ylmpt", "kuO", "OaeQ!<GD2Hy", "PpMgMBMfTS", and "0ZwYyryh:Q6n". In the ZjRrH? factor, the "kuO" level occured seven times as often as the "YzORK#Ylmpt", "OaeQ!<GD2Hy", "PpMgMBMfTS", and "0ZwYyryh:Q6n" level. The "OaeQ!<GD2Hy" level occured eight times as often as the "YzORK#Ylmpt", "kuO", "PpMgMBMfTS", and "0ZwYyryh:Q6n" level. The Ql9PKY factor consists of five levels: "QcmrORhdIb", ";#Gd", "GaTNPTp", "Nv#L^cxIB", and "iXeRZYLa". In the Ql9PKY factor, the "QcmrORhdIb" level occured six times as often as the ";#Gd", "GaTNPTp", "Nv#L^cxIB", and "iXeRZYLa" level. The VWCMH?L factor consists of five levels: "pAf", "Zc rtq;rscX", "lbhA&_(&Mz[", "zZTBiFQm", and "pUwc". In the VWCMH?L factor, the "lbhA&_(&Mz[" level occured eight times as often as the "pAf", "Zc rtq;rscX", "zZTBiFQm", and "pUwc" level. The "pUwc" level occured four times as often as the "pAf", "Zc rtq;rscX", "lbhA&_(&Mz[", and "zZTBiFQm" level.
