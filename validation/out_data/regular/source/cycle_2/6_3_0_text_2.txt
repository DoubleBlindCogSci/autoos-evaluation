There are three regular factors: ijDRyQgxkUTaL, fCdWJg[agY4t, and bby<IGB. The ijDRyQgxkUTaL factor consists of six levels: "TlK(U", "ILnBfN", "YlGhk{rRndt", "m#zU4$yXzyY", "xP(Kgw", and "nlSTn2ltc^dA". In the ijDRyQgxkUTaL factor, the level "TlK(U" occured once as often as the level "ILnBfN". The fCdWJg[agY4t factor consists of seven levels: "X^y", "SsGnoU", "HuylBEsNI", "aDZ?kDGeN", "4rK", "Rs5HmgAl%1ze", and "sZlUeBAUd4B". In the fCdWJg[agY4t factor, the level "SsGnoU" occured once as often as the level "HuylBEsNI". The bby<IGB factor consists of six levels: "VuhAlkZJuMGo", "M_vZsRG", "XTyslcxc4;DvGU", "sG*iqB", "dni{DyCPDp", and "GnXo". In the bby<IGB factor, the level "VuhAlkZJuMGo" occured once as often as the level "M_vZsRG".
