There are three regular factors: N6Bn, hfm_3, and uPdZ<ygZP. The N6Bn factor consists of eight levels: "Ldm", "chrUvnM|ZQvCS", "j<QkW", ">4lT7", "vZHr", "K2ghss<YwE[Q", "Y8aTbwKWnph", and "mrJ". In the N6Bn factor, the "Ldm" level occured four times as often as the other levels. The hfm_3 factor consists of seven levels: "fsEF", " pUWH", "OTUOppP;VCi", "hdurS", "ISuXvoVCPDP", "Qu2", and "#K#F}dLXUh&RI". In the hfm_3 factor, the "fsEF" level occured six times as often as the other levels. The "ISuXvoVCPDP" level occured nine times as often as the other levels. The "Qu2" level occured twice as often as the other levels. The uPdZ<ygZP factor consists of eight levels: "MFdi8MQhP[G", "UijZHGvx", "fltZe^8IxXIR", "b(b7OhdQPuFKE", "HOX6XppTGg", "saLs{Ze8Bu$ ", "os>jNIjMK", and "8SOhj[hhC". In the uPdZ<ygZP factor, the "fltZe^8IxXIR" level occured twice as often as the other levels.
