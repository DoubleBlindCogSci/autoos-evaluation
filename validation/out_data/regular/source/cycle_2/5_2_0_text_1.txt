There are two regular factors: IRFBTnR and TPlnvC*. The IRFBTnR factor consists of seven levels: "IQJL", "3&h)AV", "UUHMmNSxl", "qrFthpS|tVeHWJ", "GGI5Fea", "kTSZa?Gz", and "dXEpv#xE[inoJd". In the IRFBTnR factor, the level "IQJL" occured ten times as often as the level "3&h)AV", "UUHMmNSxl", "qrFthpS|tVeHWJ", "GGI5Fea", "kTSZa?Gz", and "dXEpv#xE[inoJd". The level "qrFthpS|tVeHWJ" occured six times as often as the level "3&h)AV", "UUHMmNSxl", "GGI5Fea", "kTSZa?Gz", and "dXEpv#xE[inoJd". The level "dXEpv#xE[inoJd" occured ten times as often as the level "3&h)AV", "UUHMmNSxl", "GGI5Fea", and "kTSZa?Gz". The TPlnvC* factor consists of five levels: "zP%yvoiE?Bv)y", "cS&ThNN", "vPZpS", "qcZYKB", and "RYc". In the TPlnvC* factor, the level "cS&ThNN" occured six times as often as the level "zP%yvoiE?Bv)y", "vPZpS", "qcZYKB", and "RYc". The level "qcZYKB" occured six times as often as the level "zP%yvoiE?Bv)y", "vPZpS", and "RYc".
