In the ya$ factor, the level "Fu(mYYzc!eD4E<" occured three times as often as the levels "h#jzak", "LNcGLxIdFrSv", "OzX%OfsRWx9kly", "YCN", and "snCkYKFVta". The level "snCkYKFVta" occured ten times as often as the levels "h#jzak", "LNcGLxIdFrSv", "OzX%OfsRWx9kly", and "YCN". The aKuYu*ercSL factor consists of six levels: "KTeTuHou*aO", "@JNE", "WeknS~Y", "DjFrBW}pjHvW", "DdOx1XLCCU", and "zPQQn". In the aKuYu*ercSL factor, the level "zPQQn" occured four times as often as the levels "KTeTuHou*aO", "@JNE", "WeknS~Y", "DjFrBW}pjHvW", and "DdOx1XLCCU".
