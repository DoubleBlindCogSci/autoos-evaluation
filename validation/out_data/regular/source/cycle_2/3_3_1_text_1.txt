There are three regular factors: ZdkRbRp:P, p1KMSdDk, and La^0wTd^4iQ. The ZdkRbRp:P factor consists of three levels: "Fb7dSvHvCg Ga", "Eiy]ly", and "}3QL". In the ZdkRbRp:P factor, the "Fb7dSvHvCg Ga" level occured eight times as often as the "Eiy]ly" level. The "}3QL" level occured three times as often as the "Eiy]ly" level. The p1KMSdDk factor consists of three levels: "HONKDt", "OHitE", and "YU f". In the p1KMSdDk factor, the "HONKDt", "OHitE", and "YU f" level occured in the ratio 3:1:1. The La^0wTd^4iQ factor consists of three levels: "5zJZXXSWn", "%J7MvI3", and "TspfX". In the La^0wTd^4iQ factor, the "%J7MvI3" level occured nine times as often as the "5zJZXXSWn" and "TspfX" level.
