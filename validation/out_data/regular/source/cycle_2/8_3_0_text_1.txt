There are three regular factors: [DRl@cVPj%, CmL~cLxZ, and YzQW. The [DRl@cVPj% factor consists of eight levels: "gJvZ", "JOenoqcb2Mo", "gDcj0rCJ!", "MnoNqtDHfdxn", "UrzOLBabJDku", "SqtIfU", "UuHfqfKtmK", and "kEbZmKzeC". In the [DRl@cVPj% factor, the "gJvZ" level occured three times as often as the "JOenoqcb2Mo" level. The "gDcj0rCJ!" level occured four times as often as the "JOenoqcb2Mo" level. The "UrzOLBabJDku" level occured once as often as the "JOenoqcb2Mo" level. The "UuHfqfKtmK" level occured eight times as often as the "JOenoqcb2Mo" level. The CmL~cLxZ factor consists of eight levels: "qDu4qRtw", "QOHdZu*wwL;gG", "DDOu", "XxQCLYRWKEyal", "dAst", "t>VxQncProzoN", "Gbani", and "SRnwIoCbpBHHeh". In the CmL~cLxZ factor, the "QOHdZu*wwL;gG" level occured four times as often as the "qDu4qRtw" level. The "DDOu" level occured six times as often as the "qDu4qRtw" level. The "SRnwIoCbpBHHeh" level occured once as often as the "qDu4qRtw" level. The YzQW factor consists of eight levels: "(NocRPqp3j", "Y]q3Vbr", "tAlGiEtlmUrakW", "P}Ra@juLhouF", "iEwzJYTYC", "J!rcIIN(RzG!K", "N_$VI", and "yyy". In the YzQW factor, the "(NocRPqp3j" level occured twice as often as the "Y]q3Vbr" level. The "Y]q3Vbr" level occured six times as often as the "yyy" level.
