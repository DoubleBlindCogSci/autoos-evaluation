There are three regular factors: QsiCS>NyiKOI, yVhWORI$ybTCAg, and wnyiy. The QsiCS>NyiKOI factor consists of seven levels: "u7SXgrVA", "Hd6AZsP FXzpp", "QvwsJ!LQQh^", "g$Tw$|hD", "gkOA", "FyJIroW ", and "5fB". In the QsiCS>NyiKOI factor, the level "gkOA" occured four times as often as the levels "u7SXgrVA", "Hd6AZsP FXzpp", "QvwsJ!LQQh^", "g$Tw$|hD", "FyJIroW ", and "5fB". The level "5fB" occured seven times as often as the levels "u7SXgrVA", "Hd6AZsP FXzpp", "QvwsJ!LQQh^", "g$Tw$|hD", "FyJIroW ", and "5fB". The yVhWORI$ybTCAg factor consists of six levels: "qEFFZyBFt", "[C8@TLkuV", "NuvEuCcGONdo)", "ZWkLap&c|*", "fG4JV", and "LKsyttOx#nmMW". The wnyiy factor consists of seven levels: "oOVc]WxP", "fAM", "mi}vqR8C[A", "D?vL*lPpIlXcoZ", "MtYptrglyal", "gUxcnoK", and "#ozHPj%". In the wnyiy factor, the level "fAM" occured ten times as often as the levels "oOVc]WxP", "mi}vqR8C[A", "gUxcnoK", and "#ozHPj%". The level "D?vL*lPpIlXcoZ" occured six times as often as the levels "oOVc]WxP", "mi}vqR8C[A", "gUxcnoK", and "#ozHPj%". The level "MtYptrglyal" occured four times as often as the levels "oOVc]WxP", "mi}vqR8C[A", "gUxcnoK", and "#ozHPj%". The level "#ozHPj%" occured twice as often as the levels "oOVc]WxP", "mi}vqR8C[A", and "gUxcnoK".
