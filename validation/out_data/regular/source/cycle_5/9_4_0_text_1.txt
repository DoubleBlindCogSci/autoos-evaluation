There are four regular factors: RDSEpr, [gbiy, X@pX, and 65E. The RDSEpr factor consists of nine levels: "ZggI nf5aThntc", "WziuObriIO", "ERd", "yl]DPGD", "OfC4J", "HWY8sY", "QWgAs", "oVtwy Nc[ ", and "AsKvEGHInx&B". The [gbiy factor consists of ten levels: "jYyh&", "IuHlLOFjeZD", "Edl", "E]lWG", "Y5qkZW", "!COqemf", "$9DApcQO", "&yixbxzcOsE", "TSwfa", and "(SQ?a 8LfVWO". In the [gbiy factor, the level "jYyh&" occured twice as often as the level "IuHlLOFjeZD", "Edl", "E]lWG", "Y5qkZW", "!COqemf", "$9DApcQO", "&yixbxzcOsE", "TSwfa", and "(SQ?a 8LfVWO". The level "(SQ?a 8LfVWO" occured four times as often as the level "IuHlLOFjeZD", "Edl", "E]lWG", "Y5qkZW", "!COqemf", "$9DApcQO", "&yixbxzcOsE", and "TSwfa". The X@pX factor consists of nine levels: "pUWSzeHp", "TFWMACuTiC4", "ntfVIgRC", "sSFM", "LFk7B_e", "PExu", "uO1gGGkvBhMNqo", "GPUN?4u", and "EcUgZTJV". In the X@pX factor, the level "uO1gGGkvBhMNqo" occured four times as often as the level "pUWSzeHp", "TFWMACuTiC4", "ntfVIgRC", "sSFM", "LFk7B_e", "PExu", "GPUN?4u", and "EcUgZTJV". The 65E factor consists of nine levels: "uPjIFDWiqNdeX", "rUrpr01Sv:", "UelMQN", "1QBt9HRsifg", "mjxEhahdbIQg", "PT$pn2JDit", "RFnByR^YB", "3d!", and "uVTSouO7N". In the 65E factor, the level "mjxEhahdbIQg" occured once as often as the level "uPjIFDWiqNdeX", "rUrpr01Sv:", "UelMQN", "1QBt9HRsifg", "PT$pn2JDit", "RFnByR^YB", "3d!", and "uVTSouO7N".
