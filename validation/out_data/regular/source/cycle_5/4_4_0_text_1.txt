There are three regular factors: KIjvFbXUcopz, SAmFY^1UowhBKP, and soLnO. The KIjvFbXUcopz factor consists of five levels: "pgsL", "ZPGskZAMaesama", "YB~)B!cDv>oQ^", "{tTJIa;", and "ddspwc". The SAmFY^1UowhBKP factor consists of four levels: "vEhWx$", "HIlrlr", "JvD", and "}mO". The soLnO factor consists of six levels: "qhCLBSMkJ;Dg5", "1RPWRot>c", "CK;1", "SQl8zhw", "NsRtrg", and "d:Wk3sEb^JZvYS". For the soLnO factor, the level "qhCLBSMkJ;Dg5" occured three times as often as the levels "1RPWRot>c", "CK;1", "SQl8zhw", "NsRtrg", and "d:Wk3sEb^JZvYS".
