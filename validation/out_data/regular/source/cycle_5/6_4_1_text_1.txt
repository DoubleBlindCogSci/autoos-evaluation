There are four regular factors: yoaFxqvtb, 4ctPvTkxcwR@}Y, nvfwNpK_OB, and OA[aBte4c. The yoaFxqvtb factor consists of seven levels: "k8NeS", "xYTLCkuFMA(x", "WaPjr", "5ELMv^ujl^XfnQ", "mast_Q", "xpAigKIpHcu". In the yoaFxqvtb factor, the level "WaPjr" occured once as often as the other levels. The 4ctPvTkxcwR@}Y factor consists of six levels: "L ggETb$r", "XoX", "iT07x", "n?hZi", "qfDj", "<jilf". In the 4ctPvTkxcwR@}Y factor, the level "n?hZi" occured three times as often as the other levels. The level "qfDj" occured once as often as the other levels. The nvfwNpK_OB factor consists of six levels: "ZhHc|Oj%PhJxBW", "jr!MvOg", "cYGIHs", "m?X~BKgzYe", "AdzrNrKDD?5", "5W4SA". The OA[aBte4c factor consists of seven levels: "hLpIlIUs!ICYP", "aBrUguFn", "{iub", ";PFkI#n2", "YjP[CZyBpV4sX", "|f?", "r&sZ". In the OA[aBte4c factor, the level "aBrUguFn" occured three times as often as the other levels.
