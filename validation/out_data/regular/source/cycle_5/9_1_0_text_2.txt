There is one regular factor: eIRa<mp<xhDb. The eIRa<mp<xhDb factor consists of nine levels: "rLCR5h~NLcTLUu", "AFt", "CWMql3]HUMVKrN", "ljt", "piqS#NWhxj", "g>BRsRvs", "9fusx2lFe GKOL", "xQp", and "hm9fxe(ofqgV". In the eIRa<mp<xhDb factor, the level "ljt" occured twice as often as the levels "rLCR5h~NLcTLUu", "AFt", "CWMql3]HUMVKrN", "piqS#NWhxj", "9fusx2lFe GKOL", "xQp", and "91EmrhgBpu". The level "g>BRsRvs" occured three times as often as the levels "rLCR5h~NLcTLUu", "AFt", "CWMql3]HUMVKrN", "piqS#NWhxj", "9fusx2lFe GKOL", "xQp", and "91EmrhgBpu". The level "hm9fxe(ofqgV" occured three times as often as the levels "rLCR5h~NLcTLUu", "AFt", "CWMql3]HUMVKrN", "piqS#NWhxj", "9fusx2lFe GKOL", "xQp", and "91EmrhgBpu".
