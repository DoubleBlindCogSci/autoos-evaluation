There are two regular factors: CL2s0kKLvg and hACykAtr. The CL2s0kKLvg factor consists of five levels: "TFyBEilVx", "afh D_<XaMM3]", "cFOHPxTuk", "Muil{O@^)SBZho", and "iWWjWwCl". The hACykAtr factor consists of six levels: "cil4Xt", "C! Yysz2wAXcq_", "zo7V4Qh", "IWDkJ", "hqFU1", and "Gmor:2KO&Isd". In the hACykAtr factor, the level "IWDkJ" occured twice as often as the levels "cil4Xt", "C! Yysz2wAXcq_", "zo7V4Qh", "hqFU1", and "Gmor:2KO&Isd".
