There are three regular factors: acN, qnqYg, and ;9YO?NIn. The acN factor consists of five levels: "NCxmd", "PteBpv", "nNg", "tpD^5R", and "!A&". The qnqYg factor consists of nine levels: "pA;b)<luxgDWs", "zVuz9K>H)rdwcB", "{7xhelWGHSNd!Y", "WXRcPM%MU5YSzC", "hKaRwnnoDeWXX", "hr?", "ioNKmC", "a{WDu4U8Pz(Xd", and "1V*". The ;9YO?NIn factor consists of five levels: "2KPeoV0NsF*AGf", "jpGSx", "XP1b", "8a*WJXla)", and "mctOo". In the ;9YO?NIn factor, the level "2KPeoV0NsF*AGf" occured four times as often as the levels "jpGSx", "XP1b", "8a*WJXla)", and "mctOo".
