There are four regular factors: ZSZcLRq, zwyiYIH, DpLReK7H k, and klB&Y. The ZSZcLRq factor consists of six levels: "fMOJxSSSw", "DnEDue", "lpjjMcCa}UMY", "QLkFpeZIA9L@l", "CWR1VeFKirTP", and "cJL0HWA iYB".

In the zwyiYIH factor, the level "P4SfSEsLSrhH" appeared three times as often as the levels "fwMcoY", "oyM7KDBmamZZ>C", "WgPgcTONvkMcma", "*alM(yoV9", and "txc|ozhjKAsI". The DpLReK7H k factor consists of six levels: "S&qUzgKe", "lJlO", "RSNR", "}YsEJH<PX[", "dHExo}NFcyN", and "OMjr". In the DpLReK7H k factor, the level "OMjr" appeared twice as often as the levels "S&qUzgKe", "lJlO", "RSNR", "}YsEJH<PX[", and "dHExo}NFcyN".
