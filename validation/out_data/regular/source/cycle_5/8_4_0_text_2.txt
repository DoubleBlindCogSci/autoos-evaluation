There are four regular factors: hBWicSi, SbuGtOQYEJgK;, nPIsbOq*O, and Uw$EoqJpRB. The hBWicSi factor consists of nine levels: "y]dOBUod{qkhkr", "9TGDc5da", "N(kKY*U:", "2pI", ">pw^kAb", "OyFQ5BXPxWR}OU", "mktJukpff", "dzV2Yv6vXYZb", and "hrS?qNpTXGd". The SbuGtOQYEJgK; factor consists of nine levels: "WZaHmyj6ecC ", "fBABK", "QVSGKUrBygaZ", "kirYh#Q", "eYnxxwz", "t~bcWXZlgag@jo", "$TSJ", "Ub$UGBLd{ 6mdz", and "XSJp". In the SbuGtOQYEJgK; factor, the level "WZaHmyj6ecC " occured twice as often as the other levels. The nPIsbOq*O factor consists of eight levels: "PNyJgfNDB0}&y", "FE@buAQ4mEaPt", "SuY", "rew{N4wA[COD", "ChevS#rZ^", "BuS;UDkFqtF", "bkyL", and "O Pf". In the nPIsbOq*O factor, the level "PNyJgfNDB0}&y" occured once as often as the other levels. The level "FE@buAQ4mEaPt" occured twice as often as the other levels. The Uw$EoqJpRB factor consists of ten levels: "VG[k?gJ5k", "H_do", "ee~#)BL", "Fhixn", "F#PQt*a", "dmCrz&LeP[p", "3sKJTNOdg5", "QR|iyiWh ", "Uzzoo", and ":xe!?zymf".
