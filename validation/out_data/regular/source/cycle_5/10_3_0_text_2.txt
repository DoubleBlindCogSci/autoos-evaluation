There are three regular factors: qwe$sGXLVNkO, EUIVoenxqKf, and sqaCFyLKi. The qwe$sGXLVNkO factor consists of eleven levels: "CEr&MYm;w", "lQDXedepUvtNYe", "iZfcweVmzfJBD", "t2Gp!D<BjD7", "jt oKS%{*r", "fkonJv}maf", "KGyg7v>F|V7", "]Rned_vWIREyO", "KDlzs(xd", ";OzDHfctOLpB". In the qwe$sGXLVNkO factor, the level ";OzDHfctOLpB" occured twice as often as the other levels. The EUIVoenxqKf factor consists of eleven levels: "E:(xzKGu", "otC", "tpfjp", "jWZxl", "LAAVATb(aJdr", "QkPPBR GuIO", "pzLh", "UJlCX", "mRGAIScwbKJUzr", "iJt", "6Wd geXo vRDo". In the EUIVoenxqKf factor, the level "6Wd geXo vRDo" occured four times as often as the other levels. The sqaCFyLKi factor consists of twelve levels: "Jdh?SGCxAyOeoL", "l9ZlGR", "YEIHwon$b", "ygK:&PMOKz", "XkJTfBHIcu", "t#TfI", "fVRly", "aRub)", "s jCRt:tEvJ$Y", "mz0tXRa", "?vJC[SH", ";OzDHfctOLpB". In the sqaCFyLKi factor, the level ";OzDHfctOLpB" occured once as often as the other levels.
