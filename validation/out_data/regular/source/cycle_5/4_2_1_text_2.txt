There are two regular factors: jrBPlmfLSpWsF and FXN. The jrBPlmfLSpWsF factor consists of four levels: "se?IrKzJrDI", "i1X", "K5OVr>{:~b|>k", and "eFC". In the jrBPlmfLSpWsF factor, the "se?IrKzJrDI" level occured three times as often as the "i1X", "K5OVr>{:~b|>k", and "eFC" levels. The FXN factor consists of four levels: "K>bb7Z7B", "JzEhZ", "ZyGndX~hiq", and "!eTCyRRlSjR4d". In the FXN factor, the "!eTCyRRlSjR4d" level occured three times as often as the "K>bb7Z7B", "JzEhZ", and "ZyGndX~hiq" levels.
