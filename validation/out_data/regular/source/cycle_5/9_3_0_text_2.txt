There are three regular factors: !qDN3, FL0p, and EhRYA!$iR. The !qDN3 factor consists of ten levels: "Q6LqyfUp", "SngMlW", "4gdOh", "XuFE", "QFwd:Z", "VMJiMBbJIAJG", "gHZt(KrcldOm ", "Gd[H)cXWZV", "H)DaSf", and "UM_jFL". In the !qDN3 factor, the "Q6LqyfUp" level occured four times as often as the "SngMlW" level. The "4gdOh" level occured twice as often as the "SngMlW" level. The FL0p factor consists of ten levels: "Jgfo;KxshSxI", "TY?L", "AlKm>BrgqA", "aJAa:mCAghLnBK", "dvioV#QkuM", "ej)OFcG", ">:9", "n2p!tFmY", "AUMdbMtmV", and "s|QiEfF#i". In the FL0p factor, the "Jgfo;KxshSxI" level occured twice as often as the "TY?L" level. The "AlKm>BrgqA" level occured twice as often as the "TY?L" level. The EhRYA!$iR factor consists of ten levels: "nwYY}VI", "{?$rH6SD5T", "q81aEhA", "manacASWYHb", "lNMWaaiKUtZOf", "xNT|W&W", "MZlyiN", "QLrZP", "CwSopuVm;yn}O", and "pxfy^LcNmTxKE". In the EhRYA!$iR factor, the "nwYY}VI" level occured once as often as the "{?$rH6SD5T" level.
