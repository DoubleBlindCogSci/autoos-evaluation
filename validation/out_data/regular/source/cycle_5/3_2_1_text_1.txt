There are two regular factors: TqnSP and 5QOKNrcoyYWR. The TqnSP factor consists of three levels: "pqgnyBtyR", "ZqWUWLTqt@Fggx", and "AJ)". In the TqnSP factor, the level "ZqWUWLTqt@Fggx" occured once as often as the level "pqgnyBtyR" and "AJ)". The 5QOKNrcoyYWR factor consists of three levels: "aHL", "XpLoczwKvJY", and "spIJDRGSc3". In the 5QOKNrcoyYWR factor, the level "aHL" occured four times as often as the level "XpLoczwKvJY" and "spIJDRGSc3".
