There are two regular factors: YgtsvYET and etcI. The YgtsvYET factor consists of four levels: "LX6wnk", "ylO", "6SyYjHVgKmk", "BC~UhxQyIEw". The etcI factor consists of four levels: "lxGOK", "opEjNb zCdxUu(", "pVcP)ui{l$w", "5[Q7PR". In the etcI factor, the "lxGOK" level occured four times as often as the "opEjNb zCdxUu(", "pVcP)ui{l$w", or "5[Q7PR" level.
