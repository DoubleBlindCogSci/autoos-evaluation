There are three regular factors:  KRGb]oxJ S%E, Ncvzjt~zwtl, and %OCBIdJXiSXz. The  KRGb]oxJ S%E factor consists of six levels: "<LNtSV", '%ZHAtUoQD", "PrH", 'te9nWzStC", "t!m{YqJd", and "zkWIHDEMn". The Ncvzjt~zwtl factor consists of seven levels: "vX[OaFdCWV", "VEBlp", "CSaQe#6CYihBGy", "j#n#t", "QjgG_zuF", "Or5F1pdvJaT|Sk", and "QtUWmc$Np|". The %OCBIdJXiSXz factor consists of six levels: "eSfvQg", " N} bG8IiO", "9n>", "2Y1JFWinNt5", "SJjHwS$", and "YKhkxIXGNeuzYM". In the %OCBIdJXiSXz factor, the level " N} bG8IiO" appeared twice as often as the level "eSfvQg", "9n>", "2Y1JFWinNt5", "SJjHwS$", and "YKhkxIXGNeuzYM". The level "9n>" appeared three times as often as the level "eSfvQg", "2Y1JFWinNt5", "SJjHwS$", and "YKhkxIXGNeuzYM".
