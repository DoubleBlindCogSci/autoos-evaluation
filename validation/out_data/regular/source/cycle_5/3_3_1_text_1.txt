There are three regular factors: F$n, FNqnN%jO4W, and zaOMtPyNtYct. The F$n factor consists of three levels: "gmrmqdrbV", "iOWlqg$4Q", and "d>fkJUcT". In the F$n factor, the level "iOWlqg$4Q" occured once as often as the levels "gmrmqdrbV" and "d>fkJUcT". The FNqnN%jO4W factor consists of three levels: "NEBDXKo", "jUlB[lEE", and "LJzRmosfFX". The zaOMtPyNtYct factor consists of three levels: "jo~|WwwoNpBiUF", "8hEFb", and "GXNN4C1wi".
