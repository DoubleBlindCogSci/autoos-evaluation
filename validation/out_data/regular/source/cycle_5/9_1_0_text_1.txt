There is one regular factor: eIRa<mp<xhDb. The eIRa<mp<xhDb factor consists of the eleven levels: "rLCR5h~NLcTLUu", "AFt", "CWMql3]HUMVKrN", "ljt", "piqS#NWhxj", "g>BRsRvs", "9fusx2lFe GKOL", "xQp", "hm9fxe(ofqgV", "91EmrhgBpu". In the eIRa<mp<xhDb factor, the level "g>BRsRvs" appeared three times as often as the level "rLCR5h~NLcTLUu", "AFt", "CWMql3]HUMVKrN", "ljt", "piqS#NWhxj", "9fusx2lFe GKOL", "xQp", "hm9fxe(ofqgV", and "91EmrhgBpu". The level "ljt" appeared twice as often as the level "rLCR5h~NLcTLUu", "AFt", "CWMql3]HUMVKrN", "piqS#NWhxj", "9fusx2lFe GKOL", "xQp", "hm9fxe(ofqgV", and "91EmrhgBpu". The level "hm9fxe(ofqgV" appeared three times as often as the level "rLCR5h~NLcTLUu", "AFt", "CWMql3]HUMVKrN", "ljt", "piqS#NWhxj", "9fusx2lFe GKOL", "xQp", and "91EmrhgBpu".
