There are three regular factors: !qDN3, FL0p, and EhRYA!$iR. The !qDN3 factor consists of ten levels: "Q6LqyfUp", "XuFE", "QFwd:Z", "SngMlW", "4gdOh", "VMJiMBbJIAJG", "gHZt(KrcldOm ", "Gd[H)cXWZV", "H)DaSf", and "UM_jFL". In the !qDN3 factor, the level "Q6LqyfUp" occured four times as often as the level "XuFE", "QFwd:Z", "SngMlW", "4gdOh", "VMJiMBbJIAJG", "gHZt(KrcldOm ", "Gd[H)cXWZV", "H)DaSf", and "UM_jFL". The level "SngMlW" occured three times as often as the level "XuFE", "QFwd:Z", "4gdOh", "VMJiMBbJIAJG", "gHZt(KrcldOm ", "Gd[H)cXWZV", "H)DaSf", and "UM_jFL". The level "4gdOh" occured twice as often as the level "XuFE", "QFwd:Z", "VMJiMBbJIAJG", "gHZt(KrcldOm ", "Gd[H)cXWZV", "H)DaSf", and "UM_jFL". The FL0p factor consists of ten levels: "aJAa:mCAghLnBK", "Jgfo;KxshSxI", "TY?L", "AlKm>BrgqA", "dvioV#QkuM", "ej)OFcG", ">:9", "n2p!tFmY", "AUMdbMtmV", and "s|QiEfF#i". In the FL0p factor, the level "Jgfo;KxshSxI" occured twice as often as the level "aJAa:mCAghLnBK", "TY?L", "AlKm>BrgqA", "dvioV#QkuM", "ej)OFcG", ">:9", "n2p!tFmY", "AUMdbMtmV", and "s|QiEfF#i". The level "TY?L" occured once as often as the level "aJAa:mCAghLnBK", "AlKm>BrgqA", "dvioV#QkuM", "ej)OFcG", ">:9", "n2p!tFmY", "AUMdbMtmV", and "s|QiEfF#i". The level "AlKm>BrgqA" occured twice as often as the level "aJAa:mCAghLnBK", "dvioV#QkuM", "ej)OFcG", ">:9", "n2p!tFmY", "AUMdbMtmV", and "s|QiEfF#i". The EhRYA!$iR factor consists of ten levels: "{?$rH6SD5T", "q81aEhA", "manacASWYHb", "lNMWaaiKUtZOf", "xNT|W&W", "MZlyiN", "QLrZP", "nwYY}VI", "CwSopuVm;yn}O", and "pxfy^LcNmTxKE". In the EhRYA!$iR factor, the level "nwYY}VI" occured once as often as the level "{?$rH6SD5T", "q81aEhA", "manacASWYHb", "lNMWaaiKUtZOf", "xNT|W&W", "MZlyiN", "QLrZP", "CwSopuVm;yn}O", and "pxfy^LcNmTxKE".
