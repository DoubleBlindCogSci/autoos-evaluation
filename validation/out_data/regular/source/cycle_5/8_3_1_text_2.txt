There are three regular factors: cqM, cyANfIZJpQOgh$, and Dkk{DvU^. The cqM factor consists of nine levels: "WZpwSCHq", "ImrE]lduw{Qksl", "$e&Q", "PNeqBHUqsIG", "Q<o", "cW{Ilk~y~POT", "lH;EzXs", "nnIiGKcue", and "vXOuPJKKz". In the cqM factor, the level "nnIiGKcue" occured three times as often as the other levels. The cyANfIZJpQOgh$ factor consists of nine levels: "?VIecNgjZ!>", "DRD", "epr@z:NXTgrVVw", "iZiVT", "6#mpkRrIqrf", "i<vBBQxdFIr", "UnCC>jMoA", "OqnmMYNff>U", and "eQ1|T{I^". In the cyANfIZJpQOgh$ factor, the level "epr@z:NXTgrVVw" occured three times as often as the other levels. The Dkk{DvU^ factor consists of eight levels: "JHWoN", "rFMlkftlF", "wG YzNeGxuJvE", "ID?se7vmMz", "SVJgykI", "5PrE?z jT", "Oh<DPIgw", and "JBGdUQ8LX".
