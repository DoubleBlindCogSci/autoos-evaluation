There are three regular factors: ScY, EOOJTns5VdPxM, and d9u. The ScY factor consists of nine levels: "kvzBaS9p", "2xNBOUjVPlN", "pkZPC<hdr", "?BpoR", "LBiAoA$fZbCv", "nDKyhot", "s_ofo", "haD0euQ", "uNwxfRC". In the ScY factor, the level "kvzBaS9p" occured twice as often as the other levels. The EOOJTns5VdPxM factor consists of ten levels: "oJf#N", "GY2AXx[*", "^uQ}gRj", "YmTZuAu", "0voYsEWkjXCB", "bXB%GKCW", "QiyzS6", "p4izJliG", "B65", "iehc". The d9u factor consists of ten levels: "srHT", "GHyUECmTKDKN", "rN pex", "4BEbAVO", "Bn@wDLlZA", "GDO", "qc2KMQkxL7", "0qnEZKMkJ", "rifENTgudZ", "r2KTgU". In the d9u factor, the level "srHT" occured once as often as the other levels. The level "0qnEZKMkJ" occured four times as often as the other levels.
