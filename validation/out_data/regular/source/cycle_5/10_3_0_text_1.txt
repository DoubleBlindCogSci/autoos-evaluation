There are three regular factors: qwe$sGXLVNkO, EUIVoenxqKf, and sqaCFyLKi. The qwe$sGXLVNkO factor consists of ten levels: "CEr&MYm;w", "lQDXedepUvtNYe", "iZfcweVmzfJBD", "t2Gp!D<BjD7", "jt oKS%{*r", "fkonJv}maf", "KGyg7v>F|V7", "]Rned_vWIREyO", "KDlzs(xd", and ";OzDHfctOLpB". In the qwe$sGXLVNkO factor, the level "KGyg7v>F|V7" occured twice as often as the level ";OzDHfctOLpB". The EUIVoenxqKf factor consists of eleven levels: "E:(xzKGu", "otC", "tpfjp", "jWZxl", "LAAVATb(aJdr", "QkPPBR GuIO", "pzLh", "UJlCX", "mRGAIScwbKJUzr", "iJt", and "6Wd geXo vRDo". In the EUIVoenxqKf factor, the level "QkPPBR GuIO" occured four times as often as the level "UJlCX". The sqaCFyLKi factor consists of twelve levels: "Jdh?SGCxAyOeoL", "l9ZlGR", "YEIHwon$b", "ygK:&PMOKz", "XkJTfBHIcu", "t#TfI", "fVRly", "aRub)", "s jCRt:tEvJ$Y", "mz0tXRa", "?vJC[SH". In the sqaCFyLKi factor, the level "mz0tXRa" occured once as often as the level ";OzDHfctOLpB".
