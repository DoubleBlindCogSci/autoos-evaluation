There are four regular factors: V_wC, rDac*T}psjF, YuXmIWj9] and dgjWFM. The V_wC factor consists of eight levels: "dreaJwR:", "aAzE", "TTBhCQBnD", "FES", "^E%", "iXcBfN", "Ann", and "9FHNXzojhKn7(". In the V_wC factor, the level "^E%" occured once as often as the other levels. The rDac*T}psjF factor consists of eight levels: "C lPvRRSmE", "CqQOzlzkQvLa9", "1e9|:", "G<GWMf", "N5VpbuLmFS", "Pcq@zwY<F", "ufxTm", and "KVl0YFN". In the rDac*T}psjF factor, the level "C lPvRRSmE" occured twice as often as the other levels. The level "Pcq@zwY<F" occured four times as often as the other levels. The YuXmIWj9] factor consists of eight levels: "bpP8Gi3*3V", "cY~u?eU", "tRvOFbSdEI;r", "~3nN;*iC", "XFc68ekc", "Lv_k", "ROaVqfW&yqsUbI", and "Ai ET@k". The dgjWFM factor consists of nine levels: "E4QVkD!Gn", "oZAEZFrCVSs", "L^ee", "vquv", "wO]hqOv&cAvAYo", "is*GNUE", "!vGVxnNeY", "rQT", and "XH>Pn>j".
