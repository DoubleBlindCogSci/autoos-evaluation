There are two regular factors: foBeAcVgYj2 and PyzP. The foBeAcVgYj2 factor consists of eleven levels: "vjVFCEItOwt", "cDYFfFf", "IHCmSJdC}zeC", "ocwU!Twxuzfb", "wwTPgoo", "Q]*zLlDSt", "a{bY%MZCIQpMDh", "GIHDEImSQxS", "MA0YAZ 9ODft", "FAFAYrA1u|I", and "ocwU!Twxuzfb". In the foBeAcVgYj2 factor, the level "MA0YAZ 9ODft" occured twice as often as the level "a{bY%MZCIQpMDh" and the level "GIHDEImSQxS". The level "FAFAYrA1u|I" occured three times as often as the level "a{bY%MZCIQpMDh" and the level "GIHDEImSQxS". The level "ocwU!Twxuzfb" occured three times as often as the level "a{bY%MZCIQpMDh" and the level "GIHDEImSQxS". The PyzP factor consists of nine levels: "mFDTa", "opoKtKkNvzhj", "JhDjc0_g", "odIFPim}ZXvC", "Sqo<KujF}", "QG}HqG[ER7", "gergxGLBPT7IV", "AXcg3E~yxM", and "Lttv".
