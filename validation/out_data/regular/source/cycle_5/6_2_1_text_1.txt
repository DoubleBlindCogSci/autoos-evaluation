There are two regular factors: T2hdyKWgNx#aq and FwK2y^l CGt;U. The T2hdyKWgNx#aq factor consists of seven levels: "ivFHOCJEx)qy#", "a07IdQAQRf", "DRdH nBIO", "<kl#?JvIE#G", "naOZmdGA", "%oxVxiI(", and "NmjVDdgzkkAh". In the T2hdyKWgNx#aq factor, the level "%oxVxiI(" occured once as often as the other levels. The FwK2y^l CGt;U factor consists of seven levels: "DOxJnlZahqkFT", "DzXgDP(lo", "ruD}CjaBOIqy", "!SqbozoR", "Y]nhb5joP", "qBet1kqGlKW", and "l4|IHhKDSk". In the FwK2y^l CGt;U factor, the level "DOxJnlZahqkFT" occured twice as often as the other levels. The level "Y]nhb5joP" occured twice as often as the other levels.
