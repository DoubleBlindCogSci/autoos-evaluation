There are three regular factors: NjgQFJ, OFbEmU, and ?82Q^&IGtfRfZ. The NjgQFJ factor consists of four levels: "srKtJYiwZr", "JO>ZDvyCgvMJB", "cXsT$KKwLdBq", and "KqrbIo8eEo". In the NjgQFJ factor, the level "srKtJYiwZr" occured three times as often as the levels "JO>ZDvyCgvMJB", "cXsT$KKwLdBq", and "KqrbIo8eEo". The OFbEmU factor consists of four levels: "wjZfj", "lsH", "gqeazvclevrST", and "FnH". The ?82Q^&IGtfRfZ factor consists of five levels: "uIaKxy;ptAK", "DycIbXUYN", "SVi", "Cjc|{Dua z", and "PIQ9JkUoOyII". In the ?82Q^&IGtfRfZ factor, the level "SVi" occured three times as often as the levels "uIaKxy;ptAK", "DycIbXUYN", "Cjc|{Dua z", and "PIQ9JkUoOyII".
