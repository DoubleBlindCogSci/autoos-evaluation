There are two regular factors: ZkX}tIBFirTJ and ayQBYUg%. The ZkX}tIBFirTJ factor consists of ten levels: "gxuEEmGPjd", "kg_YYOZ", "OQB", "NHeid", "WJACKaffc<G", "vt;", "E7QCPK", "MTM", "s>EN8htD", and "R#U". In the ZkX}tIBFirTJ factor, the level "NHeid" occured three times as often as the level "gxuEEmGPjd", "kg_YYOZ", "OQB", "WJACKaffc<G", "vt;", "E7QCPK", "MTM", "s>EN8htD", and "R#U". The ayQBYUg% factor consists of nine levels: "XRkx5$JmVx", "TDpwahS#TACXo", "mWUEB[oovwzi", "Q3F6I2a6tb5TF(", "jGa>L^3~r", "OY$", "1fq<E(6 &JxBG", "%a6UN)zmz_!a4", and "fIIDMx^{iX46w[". In the ayQBYUg% factor, the level "TDpwahS#TACXo" occured once as often as the level "XRkx5$JmVx", "mWUEB[oovwzi", "Q3F6I2a6tb5TF(", "jGa>L^3~r", "OY$", "1fq<E(6 &JxBG", "%a6UN)zmz_!a4", and "fIIDMx^{iX46w[".
