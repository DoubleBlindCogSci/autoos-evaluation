There are three regular factors: ydAaf6#dCAAz, et#V, and bmWCjFbSVw[ i]. The ydAaf6#dCAAz factor consists of nine levels: "bS1FNxDg", "t2Wd", "dLwZ(YH", "j#7wTVQ", "OHh", "5mJmPVI", "YSsn;oH", ")lU)tFtt", and "2Fgxhis%". In the ydAaf6#dCAAz factor, the "bS1FNxDg" level occured four times as often as the "t2Wd" level. The et#V factor consists of seven levels: "GSxn}", "7Kg~%$WRzC", ")GMEvtmlLGd", "dCZUVRH", "kYuq", "EJSMu?v9a", and "dB4". The bmWCjFbSVw[ i] factor consists of eight levels: "PslhR;&", "GXUYg!<", "GRG a0", "H?tHHF", "ubwsNtUe1yTh", "zoHJ5ovOzW", "hvIEVubmJ7", and "X b}U". In the bmWCjFbSVw[ i] factor, the "PslhR;&" level occured twice as often as the "GXUYg!<" level.
