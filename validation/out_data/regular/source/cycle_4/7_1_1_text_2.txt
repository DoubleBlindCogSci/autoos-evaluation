There is one regular factor: QpxkUz~vdhp. The QpxkUz~vdhp factor consists of eight levels: "o20tcr", "E#K", "bkZgz[q:HF8hxt", "TRdM$5L", "nqlL?&XL", "vqg", "7^QxENEOxB", and "YeaGAaZv5M". In the QpxkUz~vdhp factor, the level "o20tcr" occured four times as often as the levels "E#K", "bkZgz[q:HF8hxt", "nqlL?&XL", "7^QxENEOxB", and "YeaGAaZv5M". The level "TRdM$5L" occured twice as often as the levels "E#K", "bkZgz[q:HF8hxt", "nqlL?&XL", "7^QxENEOxB", and "YeaGAaZv5M". The level "vqg" occured four times as often as the levels "E#K", "bkZgz[q:HF8hxt", "nqlL?&XL", "7^QxENEOxB", and "YeaGAaZv5M".
