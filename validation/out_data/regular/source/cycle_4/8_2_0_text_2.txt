In the vtYW<WZFqFRj factor, the level "NXasskD|L" occured three times as often as the other levels. The level "rOjFiahJWANwA" occured four times as often as the other levels. The )FhOKmtzJr factor consists of eight levels: "Fz|wopq", "KoMHGEg", "Ik)U", "rL%a", "c$i", "IXZo@Sh", "m;UFo:R", and "qyy1R".
