There are three regular factors: kj8bFlzzZxBUWN, &eKIIcWPARN%, and iDRw. The kj8bFlzzZxBUWN factor consists of three levels: ";Sn$P0(OjN&u7!", "JngTJvF[Q<w", and "T$8z%QZiu7[". In the kj8bFlzzZxBUWN factor, the "JngTJvF[Q<w" level occured twice as often as the ";Sn$P0(OjN&u7!" or the "T$8z%QZiu7[" level. The &eKIIcWPARN% factor consists of two levels: "E&XhX}ucj;" and "{trZJ(zWTu". The iDRw factor consists of two levels: "aoLSwy_mvY0HAg" and "MAQD[8hhm".
