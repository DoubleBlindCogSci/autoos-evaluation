There is one regular factor: kMXgAq. The kMXgAq factor consists of ten levels: "RZzjWytRXBYKMC", "gkk0TGK(GvI", "aAQXO_", "z!", "N6esUhr[6", "hK{k7N", "TxGFPUBhBx", "vpulRruR|Kih", "l;", and "riM". In the kMXgAq factor, the level "l;" occured three times as often as the levels "RZzjWytRXBYKMC", "gkk0TGK(GvI", "aAQXO_", "N6esUhr[6", "hK{k7N", "TxGFPUBhBx", "vpulRruR|Kih", and "riM". The level "z!" occured twice as often as the levels "RZzjWytRXBYKMC", "gkk0TGK(GvI", "aAQXO_", "N6esUhr[6", "hK{k7N", "TxGFPUBhBx", "vpulRruR|Kih", and "riM".
