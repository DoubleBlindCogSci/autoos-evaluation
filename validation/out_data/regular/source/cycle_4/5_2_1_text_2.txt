There are two regular factors: }IhWtp$mZHNk and |8mOqqZEHfJb. The }IhWtp$mZHNk factor consists of five levels: "xVKcYBsM", "ujqZpsU<", "rYi[QKIPh%", "X)jVF;BFQpOfZx", and "BdWL9jGhcQq&A". In the }IhWtp$mZHNk factor, the level "rYi[QKIPh%" occured twice as often as the other levels. The |8mOqqZEHfJb factor consists of six levels: " ZOhm", "roW#sIF_", "b$QSXbD", "jlTd7z", "TZs", and "tDRYJzM5F6OV6".
