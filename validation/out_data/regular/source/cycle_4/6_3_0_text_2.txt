There are three regular factors: eIRV%I, Fxz$Uob?boxm1b, and EwaZ&gw;b4. The eIRV%I factor consists of seven levels: "osUdJB&Edxl", "hAimCiOE", "XbB^LaV", "pRW3HNV4FkK", "lo@vVSx", "!bPl:LIiQzwukG", and "#DzQ3". In the eIRV%I factor, the "osUdJB&Edxl" level occured four times as often as the other levels. The Fxz$Uob?boxm1b factor consists of six levels: "&uypFVf", "IfOKO|", "~6ZvX*Hl|VI7NJ", "vdQPuaKTdc", "vMshw[HSHoJJhZ", and "pqFGMs<". The EwaZ&gw;b4 factor consists of seven levels: "oRyp", "WQknLrt", "zwlTSd", "nD en:WCYHa6d", "~wdw", "|CUWyxo", and "XTb1X~ZLlgEe". In the EwaZ&gw;b4 factor, the "oRyp" level occured four times as often as the other levels. The "|CUWyxo" level occured twice as often as the other levels.
