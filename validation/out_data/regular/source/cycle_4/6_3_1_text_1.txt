There are three regular factors: jic, vtg:aXID, and a&fUekLOWtD. The jic factor consists of six levels: "mlAZbtzOD", "nKr*#Y", "B&~T9GDSZ", "B0xjrSIfn", "1AAewslQoHsdI", and "sxxrZ1aFrEGi". The vtg:aXID factor consists of seven levels: "ENJX~vDmHu", "uz~wzT a", "rwi%jIzEJ", "VyoHmOmf", "QmEkjZRr z^dE", "DpKtQyJNUiyDIY", and "OoV7f~l<". The a&fUekLOWtD factor consists of seven levels: "tSLOOQGs5 ", "KoZ", "#dM1Eo7EPc", "elgmRMLGeY!kw@", " owJn", "osHHgtGdGLbG", and "JLMygcjPqDTz". In the a&fUekLOWtD factor, the level "tSLOOQGs5 " occured four times as often as the level "KoZ", "#dM1Eo7EPc", "elgmRMLGeY!kw@", " owJn", and "osHHgtGdGLbG". The level "JLMygcjPqDTz" occured twice as often as the level "KoZ", "#dM1Eo7EPc", "elgmRMLGeY!kw@", " owJn", and "osHHgtGdGLbG".
