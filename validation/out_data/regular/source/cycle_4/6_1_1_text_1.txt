There is one regular factor: udetjD. The udetjD factor consists of the six levels: "fhi1", "BY&sLXcP", "fbcBJenTtBWNQD", "eOQNP^Ko", "nWmBG", and "zyVolwh". In the udetjD factor, the level "fhi1" appeared three times as often as the levels "BY&sLXcP", "eOQNP^Ko", "nWmBG", and "zyVolwh". The level "fbcBJenTtBWNQD" appeared twice as often as the levels "BY&sLXcP", "eOQNP^Ko", "nWmBG", and "zyVolwh".
