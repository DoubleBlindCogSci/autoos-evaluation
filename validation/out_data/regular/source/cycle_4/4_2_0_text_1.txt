There are two regular factors: mBCPXKa and eMCNJAW. The mBCPXKa factor consists of four levels: "HSAu~", "%yzX2{Wok", "TsplnW", and "w;tTlmI{N". The eMCNJAW factor consists of four levels: "eHvr@zz4", "oZD", "cBUXvvi", and "mclh3qMXRjkzoi". In the eMCNJAW factor, the level "cBUXvvi" occured once as often as the other three levels.
