There are three regular factors: zmlMNmIsOxRD, MSpw(dWsfrsZw, and 3J:b[. The zmlMNmIsOxRD factor consists of seven levels: "o&hqnoGLqDytjX", "OdH", 'VOfxC3Omb%A', 'jJAN18N', "mkG", "CwpAf4rQGNA", and "ZRjSb*9E:n>". In the zmlMNmIsOxRD factor, the level "ZRjSb*9E:n>" occured seven times as often as the other levels. The MSpw(dWsfrsZw factor consists of six levels: "SSaaahFktKaKIS", "MDrEK<QAy", "zZH", "gWGsXcb", "OqxH", and "db sNZuZI)MwCx". In the MSpw(dWsfrsZw factor, the level "MDrEK<QAy" occured four times as often as the other levels. The 3J:b[ factor consists of six levels: "qc^7(t^Ulc", "TPPZfRaEXs4u", "~JZESduWvLrpV3", "@gU(mw$tim", "4ORsMW", and "oPDRL". In the 3J:b[ factor, the level "~JZESduWvLrpV3" occured eight times as often as the other levels. The level "oPDRL" occured four times as often as the other levels.
