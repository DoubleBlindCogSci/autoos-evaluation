There are two regular factors: Ncp and gD!MZ[US. The Ncp factor consists of ten levels: "u%whc", "NAhQ2 &waGA", "puZz4teJMKJ", "vmlShuSG_h", "juX3RSd8qJ", "wIY4vATHmeHn", "~i)HFQmcpRH", "lg%9szyeLPs", "I3cUKG", and "DBv6tnuw". In the Ncp factor, the level "~i)HFQmcpRH" occured five times as often as the other levels. The level "I3cUKG" occured six times as often as the other levels. The level "DBv6tnuw" occured ten times as often as the other levels. The gD!MZ[US factor consists of nine levels: "QRvUD*fo", "b&gSEeGoXmkW", "bmqI~wVl{GDGra", "KNo D8", "gI2YFl]syX", "LtAgghskcb&", "yGK", "OFkXIpQ>", and "CiGQ^LCZiZGsUt". In the gD!MZ[US factor, the level "gI2YFl]syX" occured three times as often as the other levels. The level "yGK" occured seven times as often as the other levels. The level "CiGQ^LCZiZGsUt" occured four times as often as the other levels.
