There are two regular factors: mFqDNN!M;bv and wR?XQip4. The mFqDNN!M;bv factor consists of five levels: "zNetXJow", "DfMFe", "y_St", "WxWi", and "kGiXa5<bdFP". In the mFqDNN!M;bv factor, the "zNetXJow" level occured five times as often as the "DfMFe", "y_St", or "Lo>UHI" level. The "WxWi" level occured seven times as often as the "DfMFe", "y_St", or "Lo>UHI" level. The "kGiXa5<bdFP" level occured five times as often as the "DfMFe", "y_St", or "Lo>UHI" level. The wR?XQip4 factor consists of six levels: "KVkCfe", "X3xzKAD", "2xTlvaElNl", "HwqO", "Yjr", and "Lo>UHI". In the wR?XQip4 factor, the "KVkCfe", "X3xzKAD", "2xTlvaElNl", "Yjr", and "Lo>UHI" level occured once as often as the "HwqO" level.
