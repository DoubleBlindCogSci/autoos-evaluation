There are two regular factors: aW5XF^Ppl and s;^ttxWvCB. The aW5XF^Ppl factor consists of seven levels: "CtY", "y2HTrxgQOIGf", "LfMk7F2", "D&OxumH>", "giokp", "lwOE", and "wp)!M". In the aW5XF^Ppl factor, the level "giokp" occured five times as often as the level "CtY", "y2HTrxgQOIGf", "LfMk7F2", "D&OxumH>", "lwOE", and "wp)!M". The level "wp)!M" occured ten times as often as the level "CtY", "y2HTrxgQOIGf", "LfMk7F2", "D&OxumH>", "lwOE", and "wp)!M". The s;^ttxWvCB factor consists of seven levels: "_v0K p6SrNn", "Gpkk)Z1 c", "FCw", "ImRK", "hklgw", "@fJ", and ">rEEKoL9{Wd". In the s;^ttxWvCB factor, the level ">rEEKoL9{Wd" occured once as often as the level "_v0K p6SrNn", "Gpkk)Z1 c", "FCw", "ImRK", "hklgw", and "@fJ".
