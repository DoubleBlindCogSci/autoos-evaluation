There are three regular factors: GSScI~jmaWctYX, QG GSw|WnW@Z, and a2v|l!LvXU_)uj. The GSScI~jmaWctYX factor consists of ten levels: "tTwoWeFW", "J rI", "b;jWYhx(d(6f0a", "E$hF", "qiW^xUhfBQSp", " YSRGOP", "X9J", "teg[IfqrC", and "wn~f*fAcLsXHoB". In the GSScI~jmaWctYX factor, the "tTwoWeFW" level occured six times as often as the "J rI" level. The "E$hF" level occured ten times as often as the "J rI" level. The QG GSw|WnW@Z factor consists of nine levels: "WwSc", "vFG 3gsAz", "mDQPJMeH", "Ntw", "#|ijl9urNLDTt", "TvJFdCQLTK", "uoVl", "LI2wpgDLviRhp", and "EYWswGzPq". In the QG GSw|WnW@Z factor, the "mDQPJMeH" level occured eight times as often as the "Ntw" level. The "EYWswGzPq" level occured eight times as often as the "Ntw" level. The a2v|l!LvXU_)uj factor consists of nine levels: "kYReKIDGfJ9TPP", "NJAdmPAJXQhVX", "C$dEmqmYfta;so", "fo[RQpd", "kbQGPTj", "ln|3|MZWbx", "PljT)F", ") Te(E~GeB", and "WFsTwhS".
