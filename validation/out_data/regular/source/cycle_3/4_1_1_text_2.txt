There is one regular factor: bG*eJ%xLr. The bG*eJ%xLr factor consists of four levels: "oGwkbvwv2Y", "zfD", "lAd", and "VRRkSzB2ShWhng". In the bG*eJ%xLr factor, the "oGwkbvwv2Y" level occured seven times as often as the "zfD" or "lAd" level. The "VRRkSzB2ShWhng" level occured four times as often as the "zfD" or "lAd" level.
