There are three regular factors: oZiPQN, HDj, and Pt nDbEd7{D. The oZiPQN factor consists of six levels: "{cWC#}YpFdigjr", "StQzaAEqlYBcG", "mdIl!w VJKs", "ieUXsItNK^hDW", "_YY@y v7l$o&a;", and "0VXhtnFpwwJfY<". In the oZiPQN factor, the level "mdIl!w VJKs" occured ten times as often as the levels "{cWC#}YpFdigjr", "StQzaAEqlYBcG", "ieUXsItNK^hDW", "_YY@y v7l$o&a;", and "0VXhtnFpwwJfY<". The level "_YY@y v7l$o&a;" occured seven times as often as the levels "{cWC#}YpFdigjr", "StQzaAEqlYBcG", "ieUXsItNK^hDW", and "0VXhtnFpwwJfY<". The HDj factor consists of five levels: "x*C@ICLFE", "ckcq", "Evukv(T)Sa7tqf", "(rUjEknVcvxXJ", and "0wKKm". In the HDj factor, the level "x*C@ICLFE" occured five times as often as the levels "ckcq", "Evukv(T)Sa7tqf", "(rUjEknVcvxXJ", and "0wKKm". The Pt nDbEd7{D factor consists of five levels: "^qmIavOLgtr", "SuE", "QIixsggv", "4b8_", and "x;}r&yN<". In the Pt nDbEd7{D factor, the level "4b8_" occured twice as often as the levels "^qmIavOLgtr", "SuE", "QIixsggv", and "x;}r&yN<".
