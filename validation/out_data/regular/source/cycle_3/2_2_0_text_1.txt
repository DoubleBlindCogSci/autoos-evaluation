There are two regular factors: OpS and e0WxsEDEWgDMz. The OpS factor consists of two levels: ">2tXWexZ" and "dSH|hlFVObONk". The e0WxsEDEWgDMz factor consists of two levels: "wgFdahXpLHV" and "q;dRnYDA". In the e0WxsEDEWgDMz factor, the "wgFdahXpLHV" level occured ten times as often as the "q;dRnYDA" level.
