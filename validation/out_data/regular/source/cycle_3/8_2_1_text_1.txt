There are two regular factors: $XkYk and BpAj. The $XkYk factor consists of nine levels: "XuaQS$gQZ", "Pz!prPZ*j po", "uQ~WM}%poZCY", "2dAGZcyq]MX", "twP", "KUXy XBS", "aofcpBsALYE", "wiMOx7:". In the $XkYk factor, the level "XuaQS$gQZ" occured six times as often as the level "Pz!prPZ*j po", "uQ~WM}%poZCY", "2dAGZcyq]MX", "twP", "KUXy XBS", "aofcpBsALYE", "wiMOx7:". The level "twP" occured four times as often as the level "Pz!prPZ*j po", "uQ~WM}%poZCY", "2dAGZcyq]MX", "KUXy XBS", "aofcpBsALYE", "wiMOx7:". The level "aofcpBsALYE" occured three times as often as the level "Pz!prPZ*j po", "uQ~WM}%poZCY", "2dAGZcyq]MX", "KUXy XBS", "wiMOx7:". The BpAj factor consists of nine levels: "BeOqqMlr}x", "~VoK", "YCW", "qynojic", "%YH", "XAFx", "YiY{M;n_cZ", "BvMx hh$w_[", "dwczRb9". In the BpAj factor, the level "BeOqqMlr}x" occured six times as often as the level "~VoK", "YCW", "qynojic", "%YH", "XAFx", "YiY{M;n_cZ", "BvMx hh$w_[", "dwczRb9". The level "~VoK" occured four times as often as the level "YCW", "qynojic", "%YH", "XAFx", "YiY{M;n_cZ", "BvMx hh$w_[", "dwczRb9". The level "qynojic" occured four times as often as the level "YCW", "%YH", "XAFx", "YiY{M;n_cZ", "BvMx hh$w_[", "dwczRb9". The level "BvMx hh$w_[" occured six times as often as the level "YCW", "%YH", "XAFx", "YiY{M;n_cZ", "dwczRb9".
