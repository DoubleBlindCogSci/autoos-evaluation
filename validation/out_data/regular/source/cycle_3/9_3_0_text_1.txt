There are three regular factors: UHiOjqnbU, NjyastzmSRtAD, and HpsJeGNB. The UHiOjqnbU factor consists of nine levels: "rp1lOL#evEP3x", "T]Tjhxzd~", "hGqjd?wPSNcdq", "znsmPHpfA", "^f;!", "oE]lhEJxf", "lVUpk", "hJBMJ|g", and "AJbGE". In the UHiOjqnbU factor, the "rp1lOL#evEP3x" level occured seven times as often as the "T]Tjhxzd~" level. The "lVUpk" level occured once as often as the "T]Tjhxzd~" level. The NjyastzmSRtAD factor consists of ten levels: "BJSEyvvX", "OkJ{O", "_QsjOpSwu(", "PpzE#N99U^RSMB", "FnUpZw5aO%", "FfMi", "I%n", "VMyuf}:$TQW", "YWy&]", and "xKWkchXMInY". In the NjyastzmSRtAD factor, the "_QsjOpSwu(" level occured twice as often as the "BJSEyvvX" level. The "FfMi" level occured seven times as often as the "BJSEyvvX" level. The "xKWkchXMInY" level occured twice as often as the "BJSEyvvX" level. The HpsJeGNB factor consists of nine levels: "8WM)BAZKaV", "&OfvK{", "TYZ", "Vz3X3yXZcA", "i_B", "DEAFokd", "wZJuZQSMLLOrgt", "CYwOs e]Rb", and "|k9z WS*VG~". In the HpsJeGNB factor, the "TYZ" level occured seven times as often as the "8WM)BAZKaV" level. The "wZJuZQSMLLOrgt" level occured once as often as the "8WM)BAZKaV" level.
