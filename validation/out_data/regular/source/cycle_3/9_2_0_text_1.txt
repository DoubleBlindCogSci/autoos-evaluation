There are two regular factors: jyMJFmejL^$riP and b;xatqivt. The jyMJFmejL^$riP factor consists of ten levels: "dJI%LKQM2b", "6nNM9JzBH", "4lvw9vkCXAd", "b5v#{rQmbVl", "dnVGG$jGosiw", "CsLiKY", "X3]Xg%Ybv(SS", "sJEXiFaDEPF2tI", "uinKOa?R4NQ^p;", and "vaoA". In the jyMJFmejL^$riP factor, the level "dJI%LKQM2b" occured eight times as often as the level "6nNM9JzBH", "4lvw9vkCXAd", "b5v#{rQmbVl", "CsLiKY", "X3]Xg%Ybv(SS", "sJEXiFaDEPF2tI", "uinKOa?R4NQ^p;", and "vaoA". The level "dnVGG$jGosiw" occured four times as often as the level "6nNM9JzBH", "4lvw9vkCXAd", "b5v#{rQmbVl", "CsLiKY", "X3]Xg%Ybv(SS", "sJEXiFaDEPF2tI", "uinKOa?R4NQ^p;", and "vaoA". The level "uinKOa?R4NQ^p;" occured five times as often as the level "6nNM9JzBH", "4lvw9vkCXAd", "b5v#{rQmbVl", "CsLiKY", "X3]Xg%Ybv(SS", "sJEXiFaDEPF2tI", and "vaoA". The level "aZ!YBxSO" occured five times as often as the level "6nNM9JzBH", "4lvw9vkCXAd", "b5v#{rQmbVl", "CsLiKY", "X3]Xg%Ybv(SS", "sJEXiFaDEPF2tI", "uinKOa?R4NQ^p;", and "vaoA". The b;xatqivt factor consists of twelve levels: "pC4]5quBFbYx#", "rRgLFs_b", "Y&IqDNTxiZ", "ENeYshy", "CDwDwCV", "FJ{H8", "MYmNwuFq", "kDlxS_}VgRTK", "cmSrfDovTtUU", "d:UQ", and "ghbnXlPeFaKhGL". In the b;xatqivt factor, the level "ENeYshy" occured once as often as the level "pC4]5quBFbYx#", "rRgLFs_b", "Y&IqDNTxiZ", "CDwDwCV", "FJ{H8", "kDlxS_}VgRTK", "cmSrfDovTtUU", "d:UQ", and "ghbnXlPeFaKhGL". The level "MYmNwuFq" occured three times as often as the level "pC4]5quBFbYx#", "rRgLFs_b", "Y&IqDNTxiZ", "CDwDwCV", "FJ{H8", "kDlxS_}VgRTK", "cmSrfDovTtUU", "d:UQ", and "ghbnXlPeFaKhGL". The level "cmSrfDovTtUU" occured ten times as often as the level "pC4]5quBFbYx#", "rRgLFs_b", "Y&IqDNTxiZ", "CDwDwCV", "FJ{H8", "kDlxS_}VgRTK", "d:UQ", and "ghbnXlPeFaKhGL".
