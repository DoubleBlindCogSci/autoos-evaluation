There are two regular factors: mFqDNN!M;bv and wR?XQip4. The mFqDNN!M;bv factor consists of five levels: zNetXJow, DfMFe, y_St, WxWi, and kGiXa5<bdFP . In the mFqDNN!M;bv factor, the zNetXJow level occured five times as often as the DfMFe level. The WxWi level occured seven times as often as the DfMFe level. The kGiXa5<bdFP level occured five times as often as the DfMFe level. The wR?XQip4 factor consists of six levels: KVkCfe, X3xzKAD, 2xTlvaElNl, HwqO, Yjr, and Lo>UHI. In the wR?XQip4 factor, the HwqO level occured five times as often as the Lo>UHI level.
