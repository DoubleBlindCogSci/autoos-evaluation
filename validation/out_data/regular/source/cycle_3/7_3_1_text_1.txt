There are three regular factors: e]BLDhPJxxVlKg, XPW4bGN?BG, and Fhp#T]E. The e]BLDhPJxxVlKg factor consists of seven levels: rVFK%efrn(, ewKxWHKQ4Caj0z, 6FSwnPmY9n9bq#, tVCTaPadT9LRx, lchXR|IVJnNI@H, ds5PpnziIV, and h*iogeZ. In the e]BLDhPJxxVlKg factor, the level rVFK%efrn( occured twice as often as the other levels. The XPW4bGN?BG factor consists of seven levels: lmCt^X, @km, c>Du{, GfZj@ECU, %YhNi, qdq5HD3RKd, and HsDC^k(VGqH)A. In the XPW4bGN?BG factor, the level HsDC^k(VGqH)A occured three times as often as the other levels. The Fhp#T]E factor consists of seven levels: hWa<, lLq2i, DygoWtyh<T, AuKb^ktTOq, enj_FFt, Ez7Y, and nX@IShbxrHhtr. In the Fhp#T]E factor, the level DygoWtyh<T occured nine times as often as the other levels.
