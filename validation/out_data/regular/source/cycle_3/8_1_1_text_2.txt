There is one regular factor: _eEupC2Jwie. The _eEupC2Jwie factor consists of eight levels: "PcVtxJnQCXGZnq", "S?mAlmsWc", "KKVbMI9x5", "N^LhliXCbH?lT", "kXOOQcLN$lEf", "My}akkTrp", "U]CBm", and "DTMyiaIZ". In the _eEupC2Jwie factor, the level "PcVtxJnQCXGZnq" occured ten times as often as the level "S?mAlmsWc". The level "KKVbMI9x5" occured nine times as often as the level "S?mAlmsWc". The level "N^LhliXCbH?lT" occured eight times as often as the level "S?mAlmsWc". The level "kXOOQcLN$lEf" occured seven times as often as the level "S?mAlmsWc". The level "My}akkTrp" occured six times as often as the level "S?mAlmsWc". The level "U]CBm" occured four times as often as the level "S?mAlmsWc". The level "DTMyiaIZ" occured three times as often as the level "S?mAlmsWc".
