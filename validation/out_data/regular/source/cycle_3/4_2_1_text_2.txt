There are two regular factors: Clt[CF and P|J%L^y. The Clt[CF factor consists of four levels: "l22dmT|iW[Wa", "IcuLjigs?8", "rh;nbLysFxfYop", and "aWL". In the Clt[CF factor, the "rh;nbLysFxfYop" level occured three times as often as the "l22dmT|iW[Wa" or the "IcuLjigs?8" level. The "aWL" level occured six times as often as the "l22dmT|iW[Wa" or the "IcuLjigs?8" level. The P|J%L^y factor also consists of four levels: ";oKZhQWhvC", "rqF^P;v0I", "#iMgXnO:", and "PVWYarfX". In the P|J%L^y factor, the "#iMgXnO:" level occured six times as often as the ";oKZhQWhvC" or the "rqF^P;v0I" level. The "PVWYarfX" level occured three times as often as the ";oKZhQWhvC" or the "rqF^P;v0I" level.
