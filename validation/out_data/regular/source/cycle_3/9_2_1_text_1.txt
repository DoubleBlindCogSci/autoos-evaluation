There are two regular factors: Ncp and gD!MZ[US. The Ncp factor consists of ten levels: "u%whc", "NAhQ2 &waGA", "puZz4teJMKJ", "vmlShuSG_h", "juX3RSd8qJ", "wIY4vATHmeHn", "~i)HFQmcpRH", "lg%9szyeLPs", "I3cUKG", and "DBv6tnuw". In the Ncp factor, the level "DBv6tnuw" occured ten times as often as the level "u%whc", "NAhQ2 &waGA", "puZz4teJMKJ", "vmlShuSG_h", "juX3RSd8qJ", "wIY4vATHmeHn", "~i)HFQmcpRH", "lg%9szyeLPs", and "I3cUKG". The level "~i)HFQmcpRH" occured five times as often as the level "u%whc", "NAhQ2 &waGA", "puZz4teJMKJ", "vmlShuSG_h", "juX3RSd8qJ", "wIY4vATHmeHn", "lg%9szyeLPs", and "I3cUKG". The level "I3cUKG" occured six times as often as the level "u%whc", "NAhQ2 &waGA", "puZz4teJMKJ", "vmlShuSG_h", "juX3RSd8qJ", "wIY4vATHmeHn", "~i)HFQmcpRH", and "lg%9szyeLPs". The gD!MZ[US factor consists of nine levels: "QRvUD*fo", "b&gSEeGoXmkW", "bmqI~wVl{GDGra", "KNo D8", "gI2YFl]syX", "LtAgghskcb&", "yGK", "OFkXIpQ>", and "CiGQ^LCZiZGsUt". In the gD!MZ[US factor, the level "gI2YFl]syX" occured three times as often as the level "QRvUD*fo", "b&gSEeGoXmkW", "bmqI~wVl{GDGra", "KNo D8", "LtAgghskcb&", "yGK", "OFkXIpQ>", and "CiGQ^LCZiZGsUt". The level "yGK" occured seven times as often as the level "QRvUD*fo", "b&gSEeGoXmkW", "bmqI~wVl{GDGra", "KNo D8", "gI2YFl]syX", "LtAgghskcb&", "OFkXIpQ>", and "CiGQ^LCZiZGsUt". The level "CiGQ^LCZiZGsUt" occured four times as often as the level "QRvUD*fo", "b&gSEeGoXmkW", "bmqI~wVl{GDGra", "KNo D8", "gI2YFl]syX", "LtAgghskcb&", "yGK", and "OFkXIpQ>".
