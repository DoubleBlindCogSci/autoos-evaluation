There are three regular factors: rywp9s)B;pNz, D1ZpVNQD, and W<bOaSC. The rywp9s)B;pNz factor consists of five levels: "ol1SNL>urpCs", "ToZiajcDY;L", "U?HanBxlgxiyg", "SnZvzhVuD", "[ZSxI0yW ". The D1ZpVNQD factor consists of seven levels: " nd1 wXhC]^H", "~sKt_K[|", "LQSA1zljHPc", "XcrrEEQ&dzWJ~", "WcGk", "Yp(RKdbeg", "psxeRCdwbOqyo". In the D1ZpVNQD factor, the level " nd1 wXhC]^H" occured seven times as often as the level "~sKt_K[|" or "psxeRCdwbOqyo". The level "LQSA1zljHPc" occured twice as often as the level "~sKt_K[|" or "psxeRCdwbOqyo". The level "XcrrEEQ&dzWJ~" occured three times as often as the level "~sKt_K[|" or "psxeRCdwbOqyo". The level "WcGk" occured nine times as often as the level "~sKt_K[|" or "psxeRCdwbOqyo". The level "Yp(RKdbeg" occured six times as often as the level "~sKt_K[|" or "psxeRCdwbOqyo". The W<bOaSC factor consists of five levels: "[V&jJVtYY", "qtW", "w{U^N2Y(G", "wFHo", "mSNIXej*eKdjKD".
