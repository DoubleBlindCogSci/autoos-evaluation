There is one regular factor: ng#T. The ng#T factor consists of eight levels: "QPW_FX^Y*M", "dTD9MPpG<D", "Z~wRCPKTX", "bKYQxbaaNY", "EAQSxiHxO1B!A", "n$Rl#DY", "Nh[kOF(?Gvw", and "sgbfvSj". In the ng#T factor, the level "QPW_FX^Y*M" occured eight times as often as the levels "dTD9MPpG<D", "Z~wRCPKTX", "bKYQxbaaNY", "EAQSxiHxO1B!A", "n$Rl#DY", "Nh[kOF(?Gvw", and "sgbfvSj". The level "Nh[kOF(?Gvw" occured twice as often as the levels "dTD9MPpG<D", "Z~wRCPKTX", "bKYQxbaaNY", "EAQSxiHxO1B!A", "n$Rl#DY", and "sgbfvSj".
