There are two regular factors: wFEZE#WUQ^t and QfmIuVqDqzptL. The wFEZE#WUQ^t factor consists of seven levels: "S9Gz", "]uxfmS3bj}6e8J", "ryhLbZLomRXrRH", "S1UcMomU_r", "upmMsKYZ62P", "WXXP", and "dsQ7ezis~j". In the wFEZE#WUQ^t factor, the "S9Gz" level occured nine times as often as the "upmMsKYZ62P" level. The QfmIuVqDqzptL factor consists of eight levels: "2URpZLt", "L7eW79tbVind", "gCXjuKd7EvLFDA", "9zTxCzUQSQd#q", "EEMHqfpV]", "EgKs)uVRZmNws", "FanE", and "sN4tdjli]". In the QfmIuVqDqzptL factor, the "L7eW79tbVind" level occured four times as often as the "gCXjuKd7EvLFDA" level.
