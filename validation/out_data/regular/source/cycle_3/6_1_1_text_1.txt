There is one regular factor: JXOI. The JXOI factor consists of six levels: "BEpuBY", "N^SGXto|Cngvs", "I$mGyTQu", "jucV", "CYQENSCtLMWpHT", and "b5X". In the JXOI factor, the level "I$mGyTQu" occured twice as often as the level "BEpuBY", "N^SGXto|Cngvs", "CYQENSCtLMWpHT", and "b5X". The level "jucV" occured ten times as often as the level "BEpuBY", "N^SGXto|Cngvs", "CYQENSCtLMWpHT", and "b5X".
