There are two regular factors: Tj2z and ;DoQDv. The Tj2z factor consists of six levels: "vJLcHx", ">a<Dstn", "e|Kmp7hKAg0Bg", "X:MifqeRNZxDL{", "ug(4)", and "fTd". In the Tj2z factor, the level "f_W]B<ZRuG" occured nine times as often as the level "rF]ZyO", "ctG:tUTxkTUNH*", "e|Kmp7hKAg0Bg", "X:MifqeRNZxDL{", "ug(4)", and "fTd". The level "MjfPLdhu" occured six times as often as the level "rF]ZyO", "ctG:tUTxkTUNH*", "e|Kmp7hKAg0Bg", "X:MifqeRNZxDL{", "ug(4)", and "fTd". The ;DoQDv factor consists of five levels: "xadYQNJsPQIE", "nPsPIw", "bIqzL", "ErKccNMuoym T{", and "kvKzrxfWmLvzS". In the ;DoQDv factor, the level "xadYQNJsPQIE" occured nine times as often as the level "nPsPIw", "bIqzL", "ErKccNMuoym T{", and "kvKzrxfWmLvzS". The level "kvKzrxfWmLvzS" occured nine times as often as the level "nPsPIw", "bIqzL", and "ErKccNMuoym T{".
