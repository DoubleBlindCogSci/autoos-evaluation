There are three regular factors: auEoRjOoUoY,  Y1i, and IDgrZeSAS6J. The auEoRjOoUoY factor consists of eight levels: "lc7xSZt", "rptBXcIX{M", "Agyby:hOe", "r2eaF1AWHv", "YehMUHRE", "%nRB", "HXdfaZaJfs", and "B;~Bz&GsKu". In the auEoRjOoUoY factor, the "rptBXcIX{M" level occured six times as often as the "lc7xSZt", "Agyby:hOe", "r2eaF1AWHv", "YehMUHRE", "%nRB", "HXdfaZaJfs", and "B;~Bz&GsKu" level. The  Y1i factor consists of nine levels: "H}JQlKD9xLU", "x[IB", "N}K~LzJ0f", "oCs]", "OMYRU", "wrNxwn", "ZaZsE", "knK)m!qFc", and "Xhnf:npliL". In the  Y1i factor, the "wrNxwn" level occured seven times as often as the "H}JQlKD9xLU", "x[IB", "oCs]", "OMYRU", "ZaZsE", "knK)m!qFc", and "Xhnf:npliL" level. The "N}K~LzJ0f" level occured four times as often as the "H}JQlKD9xLU", "x[IB", "oCs]", "OMYRU", "ZaZsE", "knK)m!qFc", and "Xhnf:npliL" level. The "knK)m!qFc" level occured twice as often as the "H}JQlKD9xLU", "x[IB", "oCs]", "OMYRU", "ZaZsE", and "Xhnf:npliL" level. The IDgrZeSAS6J factor consists of eight levels: "MinwE%Bkvxlm", "QFzszNUNw*aAo", "NPbIlW", "FT~OSUKsC", "dZ;Q", "eHWbWphlpFg", " 0Oe", and "ZEmL ". In the IDgrZeSAS6J factor, the "dZ;Q" level occured five times as often as the "MinwE%Bkvxlm", "QFzszNUNw*aAo", "NPbIlW", "FT~OSUKsC", "eHWbWphlpFg", " 0Oe", and "ZEmL " level.
