There are two regular factors: Tj2z and ;DoQDv. The Tj2z factor consists of eight levels: "f_W]B<ZRuG", "MjfPLdhu", "rF]ZyO", "ctG:tUTxkTUNH*", "e|Kmp7hKAg0Bg", "X:MifqeRNZxDL{", "ug(4)", and "fTd". In the Tj2z factor, the "f_W]B<ZRuG" level occured nine times as often as the "MjfPLdhu" level. The ;DoQDv factor consists of five levels: "xadYQNJsPQIE", "kvKzrxfWmLvzS", "nPsPIw", "bIqzL", and "ErKccNMuoym T{". In the ;DoQDv factor, the "xadYQNJsPQIE" and "kvKzrxfWmLvzS" level occured nine times as often as the "nPsPIw", "bIqzL", and "ErKccNMuoym T{" level.
