There are two regular factors: Vp>JpTcEPpTvQ6 and sKXkOx. The Vp>JpTcEPpTvQ6 factor consists of three levels: "Exbj", "IaU", and "WS0". In the Vp>JpTcEPpTvQ6 factor, the "Exbj" level occured four times as often as the "IaU" level. The "WS0" level occured four times as often as the "IaU" level. The sKXkOx factor consists of three levels: "PJvPW", "us~!@xvF", and "I|?pdoQyWNXNO". In the sKXkOx factor, the "PJvPW" and "us~!@xvF" level occured once as often as the "I|?pdoQyWNXNO" level.
