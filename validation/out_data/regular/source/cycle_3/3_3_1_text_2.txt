There are three regular factors: >rY@eZI}Oc), M3UTjqP0VUHvE, and dtD^MQkuKXy. The >rY@eZI}Oc) factor consists of four levels: "SoWBiQ&YTqQzcT", "sfQt", "y6^Cq_", and "EPLv:JMYYMK". In the >rY@eZI}Oc) factor, the "sfQt" level occured seven times as often as the "SoWBiQ&YTqQzcT", "y6^Cq_", or "EPLv:JMYYMK" level. The M3UTjqP0VUHvE factor consists of four levels: "fp{G", "mEWV^bB}WiGkl", "1jI9QflgLp", and "PYtvC_ZbJlo". The dtD^MQkuKXy factor consists of three levels: "eClU}ThYb", "LpYI~oVWxscLTg", and "YlYn zR{gfVehn".
