There are three regular factors: auEoRjOoUoY,  Y1i, and IDgrZeSAS6J. The auEoRjOoUoY factor consists of eight levels: "lc7xSZt", "rptBXcIX{M", "Agyby:hOe", "r2eaF1AWHv", "YehMUHRE", "%nRB", "HXdfaZaJfs", and "B;~Bz&GsKu". In the auEoRjOoUoY factor, the level "rptBXcIX{M" occured six times as often as the other levels. The  Y1i factor consists of nine levels: "H}JQlKD9xLU", "x[IB", "N}K~LzJ0f", "oCs]", "OMYRU", "wrNxwn", "ZaZsE", "knK)m!qFc", and "Xhnf:npliL". In the  Y1i factor, the level "H}JQlKD9xLU" occured once as often as the other levels. The level "N}K~LzJ0f" occured four times as often as the other levels. The level "wrNxwn" occured seven times as often as the other levels. The level "knK)m!qFc" occured twice as often as the other levels. The IDgrZeSAS6J factor consists of seven levels: "MinwE%Bkvxlm", "QFzszNUNw*aAo", "NPbIlW", "FT~OSUKsC", "dZ;Q", "eHWbWphlpFg", " 0Oe", and "ZEmL ". In the IDgrZeSAS6J factor, the level "MinwE%Bkvxlm" occured once as often as the other levels. The level "FT~OSUKsC" occured once as often as the other levels. The level "dZ;Q" occured five times as often as the other levels.
