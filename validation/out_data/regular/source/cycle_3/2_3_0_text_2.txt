There are three regular factors: FRep, dqWvEw;1ke&f, and 5HMqbAriUXtgR. The FRep factor consists of two levels: "kQEFiiw|6lz7" and "fLMdM S". In the FRep factor, the level "kQEFiiw|6lz7" occured once as often as the level "fLMdM S". The dqWvEw;1ke&f factor consists of two levels: "VcYd7Fh" and "RPd9xPS". The 5HMqbAriUXtgR factor consists of two levels: "rrsZ" and "MaocZJZr:KI".
