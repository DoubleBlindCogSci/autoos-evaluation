There are three regular factors: e1c, DKsJ, and qKX. The e1c factor consists of eight levels: "GDJDoHTiO<", "BmBERcRytWF", "TR~OmrjLEscjK", "K@7N_q", "<Pf", "(TJ$KJ9cCjF", "sGLswZAxy", and "qlKxBtKj". In the e1c factor, the level "qlKxBtKj" occured twice as often as the other levels. The DKsJ factor consists of seven levels: "kWqbHkKZ[!F", "^xRG", "~M5i", "Cwa", "f DVVjHcThY2hs", "2jatR0pLGxmg", and "&qp". In the DKsJ factor, the level "kWqbHkKZ[!F" occured seven times as often as the other levels. The level "~M5i" occured once as often as the other levels. The level "f DVVjHcThY2hs" occured ten times as often as the other levels. The level "2jatR0pLGxmg" occured four times as often as the other levels. The qKX factor consists of six levels: "5gO", "lSmc", "0yf8d", "J8W4", "rqKuLWd", and "I<!jFcLxZ". In the qKX factor, the level "5gO" occured four times as often as the other levels. The level "0yf8d" occured nine times as often as the other levels. The level "rqKuLWd" occured eight times as often as the other levels. The level "I<!jFcLxZ" occured six times as often as the other levels.
