There are two regular factors: OpS and e0WxsEDEWgDMz. The OpS factor consists of two levels: "2tXWexZ" and "dSH|hlFVObONk". The e0WxsEDEWgDMz factor consists of two levels: "wgFdahXpLHV" and "q;dRnYDA". In the e0WxsEDEWgDMz factor, the level "wgFdahXpLHV" occured ten times as often as the level "q;dRnYDA".
