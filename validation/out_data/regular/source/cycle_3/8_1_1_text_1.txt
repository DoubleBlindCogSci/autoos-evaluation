There are eight regular factors: _eEupC2Jwie, PcVtxJnQCXGZnq, S?mAlmsWc, KKVbMI9x5, N^LhliXCbH?lT, kXOOQcLN$lEf, My}akkTrp, and U]CBm. The _eEupC2Jwie factor consists of eight levels: PcVtxJnQCXGZnq, S?mAlmsWc, KKVbMI9x5, N^LhliXCbH?lT, kXOOQcLN$lEf, My}akkTrp, U]CBm, and DTMyiaIZ. In the _eEupC2Jwie factor, the PcVtxJnQCXGZnq level occured ten times as often as the S?mAlmsWc level. The KKVbMI9x5 level occured nine times as often as the S?mAlmsWc level. The U]CBm level occured four times as often as the S?mAlmsWc level.
