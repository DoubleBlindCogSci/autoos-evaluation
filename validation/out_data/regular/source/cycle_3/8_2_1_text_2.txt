There are two regular factors: $XkYk and BpAj. The $XkYk factor consists of eight levels: "XuaQS$gQZ", "Pz!prPZ*j po", "uQ~WM}%poZCY", "2dAGZcyq]MX", "twP", "KUXy XBS", "aofcpBsALYE", and "wiMOx7:". In the $XkYk factor, the "XuaQS$gQZ" level occured six times as often as the "Pz!prPZ*j po", "uQ~WM}%poZCY", "2dAGZcyq]MX", "KUXy XBS", "wiMOx7:" level. The "twP" level occured four times as often as the "Pz!prPZ*j po", "uQ~WM}%poZCY", "2dAGZcyq]MX", "KUXy XBS", "wiMOx7:" level. The "aofcpBsALYE" level occured three times as often as the "Pz!prPZ*j po", "uQ~WM}%poZCY", "2dAGZcyq]MX", "KUXy XBS", "wiMOx7:" level. The BpAj factor consists of nine levels: "BeOqqMlr}x", "~VoK", "YCW", "qynojic", "%YH", "XAFx", "YiY{M;n_cZ", "BvMx hh$w_[", and "dwczRb9". In the BpAj factor, the "BeOqqMlr}x" level occured six times as often as the "~VoK", "qynojic", "BvMx hh$w_[", "dwczRb9" level. The "~VoK" level occured four times as often as the "~VoK", "qynojic", "BvMx hh$w_[", "dwczRb9" level. The "qynojic" level occured four times as often as the "~VoK", "qynojic", "BvMx hh$w_[", "dwczRb9" level.
