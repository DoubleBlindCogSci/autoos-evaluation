There are two regular factors: Uybr and rTwGA. The Uybr factor consists of seven levels: "ATLpPSw", "wdggRlqel", "Qyrg", "hWjSp", "O_ROUCgFYDZ", "dowiczkYJJkj(l", and "t#R". In the Uybr factor, the "wdggRlqel" level occured six times as often as the "ATLpPSw", "Qyrg", "hWjSp", "dowiczkYJJkj(l", and "t#R" level. The "O_ROUCgFYDZ" level occured ten times as often as the "ATLpPSw", "Qyrg", "hWjSp", "dowiczkYJJkj(l", and "t#R" level. The "t#R" level occured nine times as often as the "ATLpPSw", "Qyrg", "hWjSp", and "dowiczkYJJkj(l" level. The rTwGA factor consists of six levels: "]&TGB5mxRSCB", "Dyavv|3C", "bRuwGpkMq", "eIkREvKl|Dvr", "u><HLRg7ISu", and "Kfx}VMlifM". In the rTwGA factor, the "]&TGB5mxRSCB" level occured four times as often as the "Dyavv|3C", "bRuwGpkMq", "u><HLRg7ISu", and "Kfx}VMlifM" level. The "eIkREvKl|Dvr" level occured six times as often as the "Dyavv|3C", "bRuwGpkMq", "u><HLRg7ISu", and "Kfx}VMlifM" level.
