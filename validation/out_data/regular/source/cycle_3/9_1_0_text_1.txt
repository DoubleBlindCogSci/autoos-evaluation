There is one regular factor: IBDVkH. The IBDVkH factor consists of nine levels: "vvp", "MO<Y:2w9&L", "2uZqVCxLgF", "piWiEwOAGus", "yOXTOW", "xqO", "eOGELHT0npm", "u2n:lR", and "YcDBOFK". In the IBDVkH factor, the level "yOXTOW" occured three times as often as the level "vvp", "MO<Y:2w9&L", "2uZqVCxLgF", "piWiEwOAGus", "xqO", "eOGELHT0npm", "u2n:lR", and "YcDBOFK". The level "eOGELHT0npm" occured twice as often as the level "vvp", "MO<Y:2w9&L", "2uZqVCxLgF", "piWiEwOAGus", "xqO", "u2n:lR", and "YcDBOFK". The level "u2n:lR" occured nine times as often as the level "vvp", "MO<Y:2w9&L", "2uZqVCxLgF", "piWiEwOAGus", "xqO", "eOGELHT0npm", and "YcDBOFK". The level "YcDBOFK" occured seven times as often as the level "vvp", "MO<Y:2w9&L", "2uZqVCxLgF", "piWiEwOAGus", "xqO", "eOGELHT0npm", and "u2n:lR".
