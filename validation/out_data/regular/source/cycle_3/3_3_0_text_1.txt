There are three regular factors: m&PHyvQ, vVp b, and pzr[XuysBLwLxh. The m&PHyvQ factor consists of three levels: i#D)yTu3P, lvIY:P?MB, and DZsh. In the m&PHyvQ factor, the i#D)yTu3P level occured five times as often as the lvIY:P?MB level. The DZsh level occured once as often as the lvIY:P?MB level. The vVp b factor consists of three levels: PFYD5, FtU<PsDEEGvBN<, and *RO6qw$lFxs. In the vVp b factor, the *RO6qw$lFxs level occured four times as often as the PFYD5 and FtU<PsDEEGvBN< level. The pzr[XuysBLwLxh factor consists of three levels: VxaIv:XbDfJ, sAfRl, and #8zqe. In the pzr[XuysBLwLxh factor, the VxaIv:XbDfJ level occured once as often as the sAfRl level. The #8zqe level occured ten times as often as the sAfRl level.
