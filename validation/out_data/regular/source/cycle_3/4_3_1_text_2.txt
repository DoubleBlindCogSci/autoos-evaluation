There are three regular factors: ;ng, cyX4srlXM_E, and ~Yw;u]PnGNb. The ;ng factor consists of four levels: "guNcQia", "LCtiqhYJV", "RZKSouN&WZRt", and "_EVgwS~BlrZ7p". In the ;ng factor, the "guNcQia" level occured once as often as the "LCtiqhYJV" level. The "LCtiqhYJV" level occured four times as often as the "RZKSouN&WZRt" level. The "RZKSouN&WZRt" level occured once as often as the "_EVgwS~BlrZ7p" level. The cyX4srlXM_E factor consists of four levels: "~ujp*e", "sczrjY$", ")vAWn", and "zk}". The ~Yw;u]PnGNb factor consists of four levels: "aOgLJ IhKxK", "SThkrc", "ivYEax @Lnd{O6", and "OcU>MhhCK4lod". In the ~Yw;u]PnGNb factor, the "aOgLJ IhKxK" level occured once as often as the "SThkrc" level. The "ivYEax @Lnd{O6" level occured three times as often as the "aOgLJ IhKxK" level. The "ivYEax @Lnd{O6" level occured once as often as the "OcU>MhhCK4lod" level.
