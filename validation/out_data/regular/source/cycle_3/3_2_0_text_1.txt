There are two regular factors: Vp>JpTcEPpTvQ6 and sKXkOx. The Vp>JpTcEPpTvQ6 factor consists of three levels: "Exbj", "IaU", and "WS0". In the Vp>JpTcEPpTvQ6 factor, the "Exbj" and "WS0" level occured four times as often as the "IaU" level. The sKXkOx factor consists of three levels: "PJvPW", "us~!@xvF", and "I|?pdoQyWNXNO". In the sKXkOx factor, the "I|?pdoQyWNXNO" level occured twice as often as the "PJvPW" and "us~!@xvF" level.
