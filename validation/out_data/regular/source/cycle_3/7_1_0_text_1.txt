There is one regular factor: kwUCG. The kwUCG factor consists of seven levels: "i;bnjNey", "oyPYkKej", "fMJP%>kIB: W", "Xvt%QY[bbU", "ApHCipr", "i@GILK", and "BTo". In the kwUCG factor, the level "i;bnjNey" occured six times as often as the level "oyPYkKej" or "fMJP%>kIB: W". The level "Xvt%QY[bbU" occured once as often as the level "oyPYkKej" or "fMJP%>kIB: W". The level "BTo" occured ten times as often as the level "oyPYkKej" or "fMJP%>kIB: W".
