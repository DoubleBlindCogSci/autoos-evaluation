In the JKBPzBU factor, the level "ctredfO% CQ_" occured ten times as often as the level "U%FtEOSTpSwfjd", "H~evAikoDEKVR", "2UWYyW}(RJF#", "Ke?lmHB2nnyNCT", and "5xgSaZd>MXCxK". The level "X~SEnMhS" occured seven times as often as the level "U%FtEOSTpSwfjd", "H~evAikoDEKVR", "2UWYyW}(RJF#", "Ke?lmHB2nnyNCT", and "5xgSaZd>MXCxK". The level "icMpHODgz" occured eight times as often as the level "U%FtEOSTpSwfjd", "H~evAikoDEKVR", "2UWYyW}(RJF#", "Ke?lmHB2nnyNCT", and "5xgSaZd>MXCxK". The level "RwHxF?Ja" occured four times as often as the level "U%FtEOSTpSwfjd", "H~evAikoDEKVR", "2UWYyW}(RJF#", "Ke?lmHB2nnyNCT", and "5xgSaZd>MXCxK".
