The bjc factor depends on the mrajg, gvlcit, and obi factors and has three levels: "ggf", "jwysy", and "mdpjmz". If the mrajg factor matches the gvlcit factor, then the trial is "ggf". If the mrajg factor does not match the gvlcit factor and the obi factor matches the mrajg factor, then the trial is "jwysy". Otherwise, the trial is "mdpjmz".
