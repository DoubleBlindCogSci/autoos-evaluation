The ipe factor depends on the pveal, axewwo, and xwxcp factors and has three levels: "aopz", "abbfb", and "pcwrkd". If the pveal factor matches the xwxcp factor, then the trial is "aopz". If the pveal factor does not match the xwxcp factor but matches the axewwo factor, then the trial is "abbfb". If the pveal factor does not match the xwxcp factor and does not match the axewwo factor, then the trial is "pcwrkd".
