The vgos factor depends on the mokqh, rzgi, and oilv factors and has three levels: "rypi", "uidd", and "cww". If the mokqh factor matches the rzgi factor, then the trial is "rypi". If the mokqh factor does not match the rzgi factor but matches the oilv factor, then the trial is "uidd". If the mokqh factor does not match the rzgi factor and does not match the oilv factor, then the trial is "cww".
