The jjev factor depends on the vtn, ewjn, and bvind factors and has three levels: "pbx", "dmhmm", and "xegnon". If the vtn factor matches the ewjn factor, then the trial is "pbx". If the ewjn factor does not match the vtn factor and the bvind factor matches the vtn factor, then the trial is "dmhmm". If the vtn factor does not match the ewjn factor and the bvind factor does not match the vtn factor, then the trial is "xegnon".
