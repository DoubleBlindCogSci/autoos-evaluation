The smd factor depends on the rqs, kcxu, and ouebx factors and has three levels: "lzdlm", "kyvmnu", and "qddvj". If the ouebx is equal to the rqs, then the trial is "lzdlm". If the ouebx is not equal to the rqs and the kcxu is equal to the rqs, then the trial is "kyvmnu". If the ouebx is not equal to the rqs and the kcxu is not equal to the rqs, then the trial is "qddvj".
