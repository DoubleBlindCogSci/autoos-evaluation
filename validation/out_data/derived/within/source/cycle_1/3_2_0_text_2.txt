The yemznk factor depends on the factors tghaa, bbxa, and yzpsqo and has three levels: "bjpwk", "nzvgd", and "pnkcuy". A trial is considered "bjpwk" if the yzpsqo factor is equal to the tghaa factor. A trial is considered "nzvgd" if the yzpsqo factor is not equal to the tghaa factor and the bbxa factor is equal to the tghaa factor. A trial is considered "pnkcuy" if the yzpsqo factor is not equal to the tghaa factor and the bbxa factor is not equal to the tghaa factor.
