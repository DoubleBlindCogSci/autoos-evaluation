The kctzbv factor depends on the jqghz factor and has three levels: "yvvzxe", "ymvhv", and "kci". If the jqghz is "cladjy" or "aqyi", then the corresponding kctzbv is "yvvzxe". If the jqghz is "haqvq" or "apqtow", then the corresponding kctzbv is "ymvhv". If the jqghz is "wersx" or "axu", then the corresponding kctzbv is "kci".
