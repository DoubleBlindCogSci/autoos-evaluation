The djwavc factor depends on the taaa and vcz factors and has three levels: "ajplpx", "mlkbl", and "dosx". A trial is considered "ajplpx" if the taaa factor is "filhdf". A trial is considered "mlkbl" if the taaa factor is not "filhdf" and the vcz factor is "bio". A trial is considered "dosx" if the taaa factor is not "filhdf" and the vcz factor is not "bio".
