The wdd factor depends on the factors jbbsq, xrdnu, and hyvj and has three levels: "xvgc", "yfck", and "djnv". A trial is considered "xvgc" if the jbbsq factor matches the xrdnu factor. A trial is considered "yfck" if the jbbsq factor matches the hyvj factor and does not match the xrdnu factor. A trial is considered "djnv" if the jbbsq factor does not match the xrdnu factor and does not match the hyvj factor.
