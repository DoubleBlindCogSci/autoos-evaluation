The egudg factor depends on the factors ngavjj, umnwpc, and kibvon and has three levels: "hysx", "gmaul", and "vipame". If the kibvon factor is equal to the ngavjj factor, then the trial is considered "hysx". If the kibvon factor is not equal to the ngavjj factor and the ngavjj factor is equal to the umnwpc factor, then the trial is considered "gmaul". Otherwise, the trial is considered "vipame".
