The corru factor depends on the factors dkqkm, jmai, and qtb and has two levels: "rvgss" and "qdrcjx". A trial is considered "rvgss" if the dkqkm factor is not equal to the qtb factor or if the dkqkm factor is equal to the jmai factor. A trial is considered "qdrcjx" if the dkqkm factor is equal to the qtb factor and if the dkqkm factor is not equal to the jmai factor.
