The lpqj factor depends on the factors rtnhuu and tabde and has three levels: "totap", "pebd", and "jaut". If the rtnhuu factor is "xrxe", then the trial is considered "totap". If the rtnhuu factor is not "xrxe" and the tabde factor is "oue", then the trial is considered "pebd". Otherwise, the trial is considered "jaut".
