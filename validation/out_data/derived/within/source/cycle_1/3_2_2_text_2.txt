The egudg factor depends on the factors ngavjj, umnwpc, and kibvon and has three levels: "hysx", "gmaul", and "vipame". A trial is considered "hysx" if the kibvon factor is equal to the ngavjj factor. A trial is considered "gmaul" if the kibvon factor is not equal to the ngavjj factor and the ngavjj factor is equal to the umnwpc factor. A trial is considered "vipame" if the kibvon factor is not equal to the ngavjj factor and the ngavjj factor is not equal to the umnwpc factor.
