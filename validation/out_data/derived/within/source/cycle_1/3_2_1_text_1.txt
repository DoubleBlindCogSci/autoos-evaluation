The djwavc factor depends on the factors taaa and vcz and has three levels: "ajplpx", "mlkbl", and "dosx". If the taaa factor is "filhdf", then the trial is considered "ajplpx". If the taaa factor is not "filhdf" and the vcz factor is "bio", then the trial is considered "mlkbl". Otherwise, the trial is considered "dosx".
