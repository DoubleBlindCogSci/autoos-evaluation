The lpqj factor depends on the rtnhuu and tabde factors and has three levels: "totap", "pebd", and "jaut". A trial is considered "totap" if the rtnhuu factor is "xrxe". A trial is considered "pebd" if the rtnhuu factor is not "xrxe" and the tabde factor is "oue". A trial is considered "jaut" if the rtnhuu factor is not "xrxe" and the tabde factor is not "oue".
