The gzrvlk factor depends on the factors pxep, knuuf, and yzw and has two levels: "jlyb" and "uryvz". A trial is considered "jlyb" if the pxep factor is not equal to the knuuf factor or if the pxep factor is not equal to the yzw factor. A trial is considered "uryvz" if the pxep factor is equal to the knuuf factor and if the pxep factor is equal to the yzw factor.
