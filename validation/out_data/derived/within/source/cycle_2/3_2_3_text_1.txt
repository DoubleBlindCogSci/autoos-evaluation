The zfoyvj factor depends on the ohixrc, dyt, and pef factors and has three levels: "lqk", "skpe", and "yudp". If the pef factor matches the ohixrc factor, then the trial is "lqk". If the ohixrc factor matches the dyt factor, then the trial is "skpe". If the ohixrc factor does not match the pef factor and the ohixrc factor does not match the dyt factor, then the trial is "yudp".
