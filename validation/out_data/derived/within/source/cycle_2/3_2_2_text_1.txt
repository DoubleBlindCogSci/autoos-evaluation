The iwnx factor depends on the qmcxwy, yntx, and jnubcb factors and has three levels: "lcas", "xxk", and "twq". If the qmcxwy factor matches the yntx factor, then the trial is "lcas". If the qmcxwy factor does not match the yntx factor but matches the jnubcb factor, then the trial is "xxk". If the qmcxwy factor does not match the yntx factor and does not match the jnubcb factor, then the trial is "twq".
