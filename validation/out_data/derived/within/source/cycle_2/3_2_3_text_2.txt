The zfoyvj factor depends on the ohixrc, dyt, and pef factors and has three levels: "lqk", "skpe", and "yudp". If the ohixrc is equal to the pef, then the trial is "lqk". If the ohixrc is equal to the dyt, then the trial is "skpe". If the ohixrc is not equal to the pef or the dyt, then the trial is "yudp".
