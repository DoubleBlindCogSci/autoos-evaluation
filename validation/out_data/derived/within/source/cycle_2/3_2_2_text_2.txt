The iwnx factor depends on the qmcxwy, yntx, and jnubcb factors and has three levels: "lcas", "xxk", and "twq". If the qmcxwy factor matches the yntx factor, then the trial is considered a "lcas". If the qmcxwy factor matches the jnubcb factor, then the trial is considered a "xxk". If the qmcxwy factor does not match the yntx factor or the jnubcb factor, then the trial is considered a "twq".
