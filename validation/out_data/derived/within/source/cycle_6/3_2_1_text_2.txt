The rhpg factor depends on the clbqjx, axqomn, and ggxdbw factors and has three levels: "hvsnph", "qmkj", and "jcsa". If the axqomn factor matches the clbqjx factor, then the trial is "hvsnph". If the axqomn factor does not match the clbqjx factor and the ggxdbw factor matches the clbqjx factor, then the trial is "qmkj". Otherwise, the trial is "jcsa".
