The dsujjh factor depends on the tiypz factor and has three levels: "idqcya", "fqw", and "jnt". If the tiypz is "hsiqw", then the corresponding dsujjh is "idqcya". If the tiypz is "qbm", then the corresponding dsujjh is "fqw". If the tiypz is neither "hsiqw" nor "qbm", then the corresponding dsujjh is "jnt".
