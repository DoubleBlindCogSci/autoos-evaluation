The vge factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the ptqz factor and has three levels: "dkhvb", "xhb", and "wvdtqo". If the ptqz on the current trial is "hqizy" and the ptqz on the previous trial is not "hqizy", then the trial is "dkhvb". If the ptqz on the current trial is not "hqizy" and the ptqz on the previous trial is "qudqay", then the trial is "xhb". Otherwise, the trial is "wvdtqo".
