The jnvu factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the pcqwk factor and has three levels: "cysage", "ayui", and "tevdko". If the pcqwk on the current trial is "sqdls" and the pcqwk on the previous trial is not "sqdls", then the trial is "cysage". If the pcqwk on the current trial is not "sqdls" and the pcqwk on the previous trial is "illtb", then the trial is "ayui". Otherwise, the trial is "tevdko".
