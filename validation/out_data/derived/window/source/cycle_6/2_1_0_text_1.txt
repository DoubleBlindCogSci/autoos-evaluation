The cokbzu factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the kxqpc factor and has two levels: "mzlm" and "sobrk". If the kxqpc on the previous trial is not "lxbi" and the kxqpc two trials back is not "whid", then the trial is considered a "mzlm". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "sobrk".
