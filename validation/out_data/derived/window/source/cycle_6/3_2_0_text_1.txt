The uheab factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the egwrq, sgrux, and vgzhs factors. It has three levels: "svi", "wkej", and "sugtp". If the sgrux on the current trial is equal to the egwrq on the previous trial and the egwrq on the current trial is not equal to the vgzhs on the previous trial, then the trial is "svi". If the sgrux on the current trial is not equal to the egwrq on the previous trial and the egwrq on the current trial is equal to the vgzhs on the previous trial, then the trial is "wkej". Otherwise, the trial is "sugtp".
