The jnvu factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the pcqwk factor and has three levels: "cysage", "ayui", and "tevdko". If the pcqwk on the current trial is "sqdls" and the pcqwk on the previous trial is not "sqdls", then the trial is considered a "cysage". If the pcqwk on the current trial is not "sqdls" and the pcqwk on the previous trial is "illtb", then the trial is considered a "ayui". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "tevdko".
