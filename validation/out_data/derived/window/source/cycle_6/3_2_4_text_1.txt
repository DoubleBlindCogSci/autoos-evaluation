The sscn factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the ffw, qce, and atrss factors. It has three levels: "yrewqx", "qsx", and "uoskx". If the ffw on the current trial matches the qce two trials back and the ffw two trials back does not match the atrss on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "yrewqx". If the qce two trials back does not match the ffw on the current trial and the ffw two trials back matches the atrss on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "qsx". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "uoskx".
