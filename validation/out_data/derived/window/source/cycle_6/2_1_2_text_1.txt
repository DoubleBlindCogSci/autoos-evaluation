The eargi factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the faocwk factor and has two levels: "xmehrd" and "tdypks". If the faocwk on the current trial is not "ckgmnr" and the faocwk two trials back is not "vwx", then the trial is considered a "xmehrd". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "tdypks".
