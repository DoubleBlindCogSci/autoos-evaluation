The aaur factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the ibjrq factor and has two levels: "dlvyco" and "kpo". If the ibjrq two trials back is "mgiaz" and the ibjrq on the previous trial is not "pex", then the trial is considered a "dlvyco". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "kpo".
