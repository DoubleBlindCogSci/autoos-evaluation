The htfb factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the gudpr and iqmtg factors and has two levels: "bizxs" and "jyvte". If the gudpr on the previous trial is not "mzxlux" and the iqmtg on the current trial is not "qdfvn", then the trial is considered a "bizxs". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "jyvte".
