The rlxwtt factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the mch and yno factors and has three levels: "yrk", "uvv", and "hgdxmx". If the mch on the previous trial is "cid" and the yno two trials back is not "wtitea", then the trial is considered a "yrk". If the mch on the previous trial is "cid" and the yno two trials back is "wtitea", then the trial is considered a "uvv". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "hgdxmx".
