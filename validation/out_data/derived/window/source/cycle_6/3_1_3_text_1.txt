The hva factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the ltb factor and has three levels: "gziav", "zldu", and "kycwij". If the ltb on the previous trial is "dfy" and the ltb two trials back is not "dfy", then the trial is considered a "gziav". If the ltb on the previous trial is not "dfy" and the ltb two trials back is "ydna", then the trial is considered a "zldu". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "kycwij".
