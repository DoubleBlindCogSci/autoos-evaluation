The xbgs factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the bvtzbp and ylmywb factors and has two levels: "lxs" and "gpjys". If the bvtzbp two trials back is "zdqj" and the ylmywb on the previous trial is not "wviclj", then the trial is considered a "lxs". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "gpjys".
