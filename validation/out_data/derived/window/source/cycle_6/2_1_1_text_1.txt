The ecx factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the qqctd factor and has two levels: "ugeme" and "algua". If the qqctd two trials back is "aybjto" and the qqctd on the current trial is "vwlutu", then the trial is considered a "ugeme". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "algua".
