The uheab factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the sgrux, egwrq, and vgzhs factors. It has three levels: "svi", "wkej", and "sugtp". If the sgrux on the current trial matches the egwrq on the previous trial and the egwrq on the current trial does not match the vgzhs on the previous trial, then the trial is "svi". If the sgrux on the current trial does not match the egwrq on the previous trial and the egwrq on the current trial matches the vgzhs on the previous trial, then the trial is "wkej". Otherwise, the trial is "sugtp".
