The xex factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the axm factor and has two levels: "vdxf" and "dixnld". If the axm two trials back is not "oblzx" and the axm on the previous trial is "qgwsjr", then the trial is considered a "vdxf". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "dixnld".
