The fsgf factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the ago factor and has three levels: "pjd", "hjqc", and "kqaxgo". If the ago on the previous trial is "bbbn" and the ago on the current trial is not "bbbn", then the trial is considered a "pjd". If the ago on the previous trial is not "bbbn" and the ago on the current trial is "fhtx", then the trial is considered a "hjqc". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "kqaxgo".
