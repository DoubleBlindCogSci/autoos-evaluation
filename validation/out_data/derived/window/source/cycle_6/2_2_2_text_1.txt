The rcxfsi factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the djaod and moccj factors and has two levels: "ocebmw" and "ysotd". If the djaod on the previous trial is not "xvdbtl" and the moccj on the current trial is "aywgfe", then the trial is considered a "ocebmw". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "ysotd".
