The nlgc factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the orv, umaucr, and fdcldf factors. It has two levels: "ayso" and "asl". If the orv on the previous trial matches the umaucr on the current trial and the orv on the current trial matches the fdcldf on the previous trial, then the trial is "ayso". Otherwise, the trial is "asl".
