The xlyjlo factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the mfrme and tnwi factors and has three levels: "ztgo", "rqcz", and "qfujr". If the mfrme on the current trial is "wii" and the tnwi two trials back is not "kste", then the trial is "ztgo". If the mfrme on the current trial is not "wii" and the tnwi two trials back is "kste", then the trial is "rqcz". Otherwise, the trial is "qfujr".
