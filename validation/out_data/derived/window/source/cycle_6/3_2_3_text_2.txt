The rvvq factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the jwovfi and wouq factors and has three levels: "pfim", "suvb", and "ekb". If the jwovfi two trials back is "lvff" and the wouq is not "dpvb", then the trial is "pfim". If the jwovfi two trials back is not "lvff" and the wouq is "dpvb", then the trial is "suvb". Otherwise, the trial is "ekb".
