The qwkebc factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the ensgf factor and has three levels: "gynbxm", "bknfk", and "nqatc". If the ensgf two trials back is "vln" and the ensgf on the previous trial is not "vln", then the trial is considered a "gynbxm". If the ensgf two trials back is not "vln" and the ensgf on the previous trial is "mbemo", then the trial is considered a "bknfk". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "nqatc".
