The yaehve factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the mfz, jtrvnd, and zrs factors. It has three levels: "rap", "gpksp", and "xqjhvf". If the zrs on the current trial matches the mfz on the previous trial, then the trial is considered a "rap". If the zrs on the current trial does not match the mfz on the previous trial and the jtrvnd on the current trial matches the mfz on the second-to-last trial, then the trial is considered a "gpksp". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "xqjhvf".
