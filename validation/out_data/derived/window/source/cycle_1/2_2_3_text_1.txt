The dsny factor has two levels: "hxibgp" and "cbvbbo". It depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the lnc, ziyuus, and fpj factors. If the lnc on the current trial does not match the ziyuus on the previous trial, then the trial is considered a "hxibgp". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "cbvbbo".
