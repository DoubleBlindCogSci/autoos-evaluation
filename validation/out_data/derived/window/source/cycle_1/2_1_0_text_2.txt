The jmyrao factor has two levels: "ucfyzp" and "pca". It depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the tmkwf factor. If the tmkwf on the current trial is not "jzpu" and the tmkwf on the previous trial is "simzsx", then the trial is considered a "ucfyzp". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "pca".
