The shrv factor has three levels: "ngmg", "jvk", and "jrldp". It depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the tprnu factor. If the tprnu on the current trial matches the tprnu two trials back, then the trial is "ngmg". If the tprnu on the current trial matches the tprnu one trial back, then the trial is "jvk". Otherwise, the trial is "jrldp".
