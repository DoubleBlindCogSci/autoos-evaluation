The cal factor has two levels: "amfn" and "jyet". It depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the bxuppq and ckg factors. If the bxuppq factor on the current trial is "frl" and the ckg factor on the current trial is "eedo", then the trial is "amfn". Otherwise, the trial is "jyet".
