The jtk factor has three levels: "eabp", "csw", and "zjiomh". It depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the qbxrsc factor. If the qbxrsc on the current trial matches the qbxrsc three trials back, then the trial is considered an "eabp". If the qbxrsc on the current trial matches the qbxrsc one trial back, then the trial is considered a "csw". Otherwise, the current trial is "zjiomh".
