The gtv factor has three levels: "trma", "zvclql", and "wpip". It depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the rqr, dqmt, and mxu factors. If the rqr factor on the current trial matches the dqmt factor two trials back, then the trial is considered a "trma". If the rqr factor on the current trial does not match the dqmt factor two trials back and the mxu factor on the current trial matches the dqmt factor one trial back, then the trial is considered a "zvclql". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "wpip".
