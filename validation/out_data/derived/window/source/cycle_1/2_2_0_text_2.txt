The eanb factor has two levels: "ddgmep" and "usy". It depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the avahh, gzc, and wzfxxn factors. If the avahh on the current trial matches the gzc two trials back or if the avahh on the current trial does not match the wzfxxn one trial back, then the trial is "ddgmep". Otherwise, the trial is "usy".
