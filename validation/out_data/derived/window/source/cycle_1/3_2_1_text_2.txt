The nsaqy factor has three levels: "xkn", "bxvp", and "ylwc". It depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the bsy, nopd, and fhq factors. If the bsy factor on the current trial matches the nopd factor three trials back, then the trial is considered "xkn". If the bsy factor on the current trial does not match the nopd factor three trials back and the fhq factor on the current trial matches the bsy factor three trials back, then the trial is considered "bxvp". Otherwise, the trial is considered "ylwc".
