The lxcta factor has three levels: "wql", "byxd", and "rnzv". It depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the mjsmfy, uubtu, and jqdmb factors. If the jqdmb on the current trial matches the mjsmfy two trials back, then the trial is considered a "wql". If the jqdmb on the current trial does not match the mjsmfy two trials back and the mjsmfy on the current trial matches the uubtu two trials back, then the trial is considered a "byxd". If the jqdmb on the current trial does not match the mjsmfy two trials back and the mjsmfy on the current trial does not match the uubtu two trials back, then the trial is considered a "rnzv".
