The gtv factor has three levels: "trma", "zvclql", and "wpip". It depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the dqmt, rqr, and mxu factors. If the rqr on the current trial matches the dqmt two trials back, then the trial is considered a "trma". If the rqr on the current trial does not match the dqmt two trials back and the mxu on the current trial matches the dqmt one trial back, then the trial is considered a "zvclql". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "wpip".
