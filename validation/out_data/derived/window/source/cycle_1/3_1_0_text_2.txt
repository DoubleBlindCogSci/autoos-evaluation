The tyruji factor has three levels: "kbpq", "bmb", and "nfzkw". It depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the vxqndv factor. If the vxqndv on the current trial matches the vxqndv two trials back, then the trial is considered a "kbpq". If the vxqndv on the current trial matches the vxqndv one trial back, then the trial is considered a "bmb". Otherwise, the current trial is considered a "nfzkw".
