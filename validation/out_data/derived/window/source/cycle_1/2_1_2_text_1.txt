The uix factor has two levels: "mzrq" and "bfurc". It depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the qasz factor. If the qasz on the current trial is not "jyxdrm" and the qasz on the current trial is not "optefg", then the trial is "mzrq". Otherwise, the trial is "bfurc".
