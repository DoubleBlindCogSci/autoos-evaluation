The ykb factor has two levels: "dlg" and "ooynm". It depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the yrcneo and ixp factors. If the yrcneo on the current trial does not match the yrcneo four trials back and the ixp on the current trial does not match the ixp on the previous trial, then the trial is "dlg". Otherwise, the trial is "ooynm".
