The xcic factor has three levels: "lfli", "fovsd", and "sfo". It depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the tqywwe factor. If the tqywwe on the current trial is "dshe", then the trial is considered a "lfli". If the tqywwe on the current trial is "givaf", then the trial is considered a "fovsd". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "sfo".
