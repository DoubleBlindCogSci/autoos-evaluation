The efpet factor has three levels: "bzh", "edv", and "ymqe". It depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the rbem factor. If the rbem on the current trial matches the rbem on the previous trial, then the trial is considered a "bzh". If the rbem on the current trial matches the rbem two trials back, then the trial is considered a "edv". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "ymqe".
