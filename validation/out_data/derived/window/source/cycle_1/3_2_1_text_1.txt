The nsaqy factor has three levels: "xkn", "bxvp", and "ylwc". It depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the bsy, nopd, and fhq factors. If the bsy on the current trial matches the nopd three trials back, then the trial is considered an "xkn". If the nopd three trials back does not match the bsy on the current trial and the fhq on the current trial matches the bsy three trials back, then the trial is considered a "bxvp". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "ylwc".
