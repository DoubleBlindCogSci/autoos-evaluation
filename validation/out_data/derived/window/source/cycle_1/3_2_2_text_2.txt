The yaehve factor has three levels: "rap", "gpksp", and "xqjhvf". It depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the zrs, mfz, and jtrvnd factors. If the zrs on the current trial matches the mfz on the previous trial, then the trial is considered a "rap". If the zrs on the current trial does not match the mfz on the previous trial and the jtrvnd on the current trial matches the mfz on the trial before the previous trial, then the trial is considered a "gpksp". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "xqjhvf".
