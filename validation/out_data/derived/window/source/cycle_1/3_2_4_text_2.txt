The lxcta factor has three levels: "wql", "byxd", and "rnzv". It depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the jqdmb, mjsmfy, and uubtu factors. If the jqdmb on the current trial matches the mjsmfy two trials back, then the trial is considered a "wql". If the mjsmfy on the current trial matches the uubtu two trials back, then the trial is considered a "byxd". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "rnzv".
