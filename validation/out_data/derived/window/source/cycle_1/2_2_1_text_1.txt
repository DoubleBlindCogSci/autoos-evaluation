The bsgkzr factor has two levels: "bzafu" and "doedz". It depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the rrinkq and nrt factors. If the rrinkq on the current trial does not match "ejtynj" or if the nrt on the current trial matches "pxg", then the trial is considered a "bzafu". Conversely, if the rrinkq on the current trial matches "ejtynj" and the nrt on the current trial does not match "pxg", then the trial is considered a "doedz".
