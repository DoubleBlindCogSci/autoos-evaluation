The bsgkzr factor has two levels: "bzafu" and "doedz". It depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the rrinkq and nrt factors. If the rrinkq factor on the current trial is not "ejtynj" or if the nrt factor on the current trial is "pxg", then the trial is considered a "bzafu". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "doedz".
