The yzrhbj factor has three levels: "rlntfd", "ipwd", and "crte". It depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the kpzzs, yfbw, and pelwq factors. If the yfbw on the current trial matches the kpzzs three trials back, then the trial is considered a "rlntfd". If the yfbw on the current trial does not match the kpzzs three trials back and the pelwq on the current trial matches the kpzzs one trial back, then the trial is considered a "ipwd". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "crte".
