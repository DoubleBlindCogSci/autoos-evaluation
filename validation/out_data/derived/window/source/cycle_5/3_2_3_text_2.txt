The nwm factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the zwin and tqxev factors and has three levels: "fbnbrn", "gex", and "gliqlb". If the zwin on the previous trial is "tid" and the tqxev on the current trial is not "yub", then the trial is "fbnbrn". If the zwin on the previous trial is not "tid" and the tqxev on the current trial is "yub", then the trial is "gex". Otherwise, the trial is "gliqlb".
