The hkfpd factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the vusvwj and rqpzlq factors and has three levels: "gqrznp", "fha", and "jkz". If the vusvwj two trials back is "doe" and the rqpzlq on the previous trial is not "xfwdfh", then the trial is considered a "gqrznp". If the vusvwj two trials back is not "doe" and the rqpzlq on the previous trial is "xfwdfh", then the trial is considered a "fha". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "jkz".
