The kfz factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the msghmm factor and has three levels: "gbpdob", "aei", and "pve". If the msghmm two trials back is "frtoj" and the msghmm on the current trial is not "frtoj", then the trial is considered a "gbpdob". If the msghmm two trials back is not "frtoj" and the msghmm on the current trial is "ruxh", then the trial is considered an "aei". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "pve".
