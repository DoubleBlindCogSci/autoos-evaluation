The pug factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the ffp factor and has three levels: "ydoqi", "qsap", and "vgta". If the ffp two trials back is "rbc" and the ffp on the previous trial is not "rbc", then the trial is considered a "ydoqi". If the ffp two trials back is not "rbc" and the ffp on the previous trial is "buekwg", then the trial is considered a "qsap". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "vgta".
