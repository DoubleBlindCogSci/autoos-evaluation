The hyjga factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the ehx factor and has two levels: "baxa" and "ebsnz". If the ehx on the previous trial is not "qdmyk" or the ehx on the current trial is "uee", then the trial is considered a "baxa". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "ebsnz".
