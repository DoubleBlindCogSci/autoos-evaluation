The iljb factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the cbjmq and xtm factors and has two levels: "lzwjda" and "wkx". If the cbjmq two trials back is not "sho" or the xtm on the current trial is not "cshg", then the trial is considered a "lzwjda". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "wkx".
