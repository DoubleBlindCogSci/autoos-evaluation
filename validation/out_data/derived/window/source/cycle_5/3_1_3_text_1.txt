The rvuld factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the jkoa factor and has three levels: "cwq", "uworl", and "xvza". If the jkoa on the current trial is "dty" and the jkoa on the previous trial is not "dty", then the trial is considered a "cwq". If the jkoa on the current trial is not "dty" and the jkoa on the previous trial is "rdrtvh", then the trial is considered a "uworl". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "xvza".
