The owcv factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the eov, jryyb, and fnan factors. It has three levels: "qfcwn", "tvzgy", and "pgdgge". If the eov on the previous trial matches the jryyb on the current trial and the eov on the current trial does not match the fnan on the previous trial, then the trial is "qfcwn". If the jryyb on the current trial does not match the eov on the previous trial and the fnan on the previous trial matches the eov on the current trial, then the trial is "tvzgy". Otherwise, the trial is "pgdgge".
