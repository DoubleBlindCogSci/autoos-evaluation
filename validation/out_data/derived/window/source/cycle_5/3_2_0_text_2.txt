The hkfpd factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the vusvwj and rqpzlq factors and has three levels: "gqrznp", "fha", and "jkz". If the vusvwj two trials back is "doe" and the rqpzlq on the previous trial is not "xfwdfh", then the trial is "gqrznp". If the vusvwj two trials back is not "doe" and the rqpzlq on the previous trial is "xfwdfh", then the trial is "fha". Otherwise, the trial is "jkz".
