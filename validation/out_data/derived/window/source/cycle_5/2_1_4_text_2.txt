The cyt factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the jlb factor and has two levels: "jklom" and "kkkge". If the jlb on the previous trial is not "vmokyj" or the jlb on the current trial is "aklr", then the trial is considered a "jklom". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "kkkge".
