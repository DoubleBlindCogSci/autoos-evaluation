The hhvfof factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the dmjbcm factor and has three levels: "aljh", "mdvn", and "qie". If the dmjbcm two trials back is "kiywln" and the dmjbcm on the previous trial is not "kiywln", then the trial is considered a "aljh". If the dmjbcm two trials back is not "kiywln" and the dmjbcm on the previous trial is "aahlc", then the trial is considered a "mdvn". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "qie".
