The hhvfof factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the dmjbcm factor and has three levels: "aljh", "mdvn", and "qie". If the dmjbcm two trials back is "kiywln" and the dmjbcm on the previous trial is not "kiywln", then the trial is considered "aljh". If the dmjbcm two trials back is not "kiywln" and the dmjbcm on the previous trial is "aahlc", then the trial is considered "mdvn". Otherwise, the trial is considered "qie".
