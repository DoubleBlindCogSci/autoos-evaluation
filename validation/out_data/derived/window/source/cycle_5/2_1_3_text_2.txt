The auvl factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the cltze factor and has two levels: "iyqnrx" and "zbaapf". If the cltze on the previous trial is not "reqqt" and the cltze on the current trial is "btbfe", then the trial is considered "iyqnrx". Otherwise, the trial is considered "zbaapf".
