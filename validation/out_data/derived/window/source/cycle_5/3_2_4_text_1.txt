The dhaal factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the rxerxr, begh, and jwacc factors. It has three levels: "woyerc", "xpt", and "vblwpg". If the begh two trials back is equal to the rxerxr on the current trial and the rxerxr two trials back is not equal to the jwacc on the current trial, then the trial is "woyerc". If the begh two trials back is not equal to the rxerxr on the current trial and the rxerxr two trials back is equal to the jwacc on the current trial, then the trial is "xpt". If the begh two trials back is not equal to the rxerxr on the current trial and the rxerxr two trials back is not equal to the jwacc on the current trial, then the trial is "vblwpg".
