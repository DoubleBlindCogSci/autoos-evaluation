The rwnqf factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the xkvzol, xeyjrr, and fdwq factors. It has three levels: "cwkz", "uvpjb", and "ihyhas". If the xkvzol two trials back matches the xeyjrr on the previous trial and the xkvzol on the previous trial does not match the fdwq two trials back, then the trial is considered a "cwkz". If the xeyjrr on the previous trial does not match the xkvzol two trials back and the xkvzol on the previous trial matches the fdwq two trials back, then the trial is considered a "uvpjb". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "ihyhas".
