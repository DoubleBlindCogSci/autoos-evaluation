The dhaal factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the rxerxr, begh, and jwacc factors. It has three levels: "woyerc", "xpt", and "vblwpg". If the begh two trials back matches the rxerxr of the current trial and the rxerxr two trials back does not match the jwacc of the current trial, then the trial is considered a "woyerc". If the begh two trials back does not match the rxerxr of the current trial and the rxerxr two trials back matches the jwacc of the current trial, then the trial is considered a "xpt". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "vblwpg".
