The yadag factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the lxnxij, xhik, and llerqc factors. It has two levels: "lbfgh" and "dwtgix". If the lxnxij on the previous trial matches the xhik two trials back and the lxnxij two trials back matches the llerqc on the previous trial, then the trial is considered a "lbfgh". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "dwtgix".
