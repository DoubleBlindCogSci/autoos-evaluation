The ulhgwg factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the ephyg factor and has three levels: "pxky", "bcsghi", and "gmpmeb". If the ephyg on the current trial is "ofycwv" and the ephyg on the previous trial is not "ofycwv", then the trial is "pxky". If the ephyg on the current trial is not "ofycwv" and the ephyg on the previous trial is "vcnwcv", then the trial is "bcsghi". Otherwise, the trial is "gmpmeb".
