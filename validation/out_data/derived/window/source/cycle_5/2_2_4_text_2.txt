The ibcdmx factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the dctt and zftfq factors and has two levels: "uuov" and "npy". If the dctt two trials back is not "oiq" or the zftfq on the current trial is "tkrv", then the trial is considered a "uuov". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "npy".
