The knikh factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the fmxd factor and has three levels: "wnlbw", "hsdr", and "nykz". If the fmxd on the previous trial is "hcosa" and the fmxd on the current trial is not "hcosa", then the trial is considered a "wnlbw". If the fmxd on the previous trial is not "hcosa" and the fmxd on the current trial is "maa", then the trial is considered a "hsdr". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "nykz".
