The dzcim factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the rwrsdm, rxykvf, and vmyy factors. It has three levels: "qsaeu", "ehbbeo", and "lec". If the rxykvf three trials back matches the rwrsdm on the previous trial and the rwrsdm three trials back does not match the vmyy on the previous trial, then the trial is considered a "qsaeu". If the rxykvf three trials back does not match the rwrsdm on the previous trial and the rwrsdm three trials back matches the vmyy on the previous trial, then the trial is considered a "ehbbeo". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "lec".
