The yaeoo factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the hxtcdr factor and has two levels: "vtwb" and "tzocpv". If the hxtcdr three trials back is not "tjlgc" or the hxtcdr on the current trial is "bwrbl", then the trial is considered a "vtwb". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "tzocpv".
