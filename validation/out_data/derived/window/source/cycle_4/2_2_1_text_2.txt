The vri factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the sdsksb and mlrmj factors and has two levels: "bsene" and "efsxc". If the sdsksb three trials back is not "eyqoh" and the mlrmj on the previous trial is "xadjr", then the trial is considered a "bsene". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "efsxc".
