The zfdgl factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the onfbo, nbq, and rim factors. It has three levels: "chq", "zfnpyb", and "foaw". If the onfbo three trials back matches the nbq two trials back and the onfbo two trials back does not match the rim three trials back, then the trial is considered a "chq". If the nbq two trials back does not match the onfbo three trials back and the onfbo two trials back matches the rim three trials back, then the trial is considered a "zfnpyb". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "foaw".
