The kjq factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the uqwxh, vwoe, and ckstue factors. It has three levels: "mfqks", "ifgsok", and "xywkiw". If the uqwxh three trials back matches the ckstue on the current trial and the uqwxh on the current trial does not match the vwoe three trials back, then the trial is "mfqks". If the ckstue on the current trial does not match the uqwxh three trials back and the uqwxh on the current trial matches the vwoe three trials back, then the trial is "ifgsok". Otherwise, the trial is "xywkiw".
