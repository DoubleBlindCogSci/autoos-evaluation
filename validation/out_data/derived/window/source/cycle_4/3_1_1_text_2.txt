The piqz factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the pqdejc factor and has three levels: "ksm", "njg", and "dbkie". If the pqdejc on the current trial is "okanp" and the pqdejc on the previous trial is not "okanp", then the trial is "ksm". If the pqdejc on the current trial is not "okanp" and the pqdejc two trials back is "edsktp", then the trial is "njg". Otherwise, the trial is "dbkie".
