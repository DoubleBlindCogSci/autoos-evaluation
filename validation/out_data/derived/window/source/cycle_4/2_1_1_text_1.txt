The fwcwhx factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the ldnw factor and has two levels: "qyw" and "esrlc". If the ldnw on the current trial is "iziur" or the ldnw on the previous trial is "mly", then the trial is considered a "qyw". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "esrlc".
