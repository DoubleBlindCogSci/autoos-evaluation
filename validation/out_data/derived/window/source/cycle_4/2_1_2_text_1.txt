The cixq factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the wgy factor and has two levels: "mqes" and "fexbma". If the wgy three trials back is "kexsa" and the wgy on the previous trial is not "yqwqrq", then the trial is considered a "mqes". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "fexbma".
