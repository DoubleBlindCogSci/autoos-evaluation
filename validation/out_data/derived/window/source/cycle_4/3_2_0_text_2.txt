The ogak factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the iuuz, pfwafi, and dxcv factors. It has three levels: "uik", "rrqftz", and "rxcigz". If the iuuz on the current trial matches the dxcv three trials back and the iuuz three trials back does not match the pfwafi on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "uik". If the dxcv three trials back does not match the iuuz on the current trial and the iuuz three trials back matches the pfwafi on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "rrqftz". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "rxcigz".
