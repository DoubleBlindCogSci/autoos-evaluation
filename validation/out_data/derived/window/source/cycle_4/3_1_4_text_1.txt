The brsv factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the miyzdq factor and has three levels: "animf", "dpmihp", and "ypsd". If the miyzdq two trials back is "klaaay" and the miyzdq on the current trial is not "klaaay", then the trial is "animf". If the miyzdq two trials back is not "klaaay" and the miyzdq on the current trial is "aalk", then the trial is "dpmihp". Otherwise, the trial is "ypsd".
