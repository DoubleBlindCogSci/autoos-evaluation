The zbomms factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the xdmw and jbuwv factors and has two levels: "zyvsm" and "yqfyl". If the xdmw on the current trial is not "toqcz" or the jbuwv on the previous trial is "vjw", then the trial is considered a "zyvsm". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "yqfyl".
