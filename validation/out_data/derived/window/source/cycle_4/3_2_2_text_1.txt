The knehq factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the zgwty, muz, and isi factors. It has three levels: "lfnwwo", "sdddpo", and "vyjx". If the zgwty on the current trial matches the isi three trials back and the zgwty three trials back does not match the muz on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "lfnwwo". If the isi three trials back does not match the zgwty on the current trial and the zgwty three trials back matches the muz on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "sdddpo". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "vyjx".
