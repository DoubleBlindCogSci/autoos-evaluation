The mfnjeh factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the zdbxi factor and has three levels: "nud", "uah", and "ugi". If the zdbxi on the previous trial is "pnqr" and the zdbxi on the current trial is not "pnqr", then the trial is considered a "nud". If the zdbxi on the previous trial is not "pnqr" and the zdbxi on the current trial is "edln", then the trial is considered a "uah". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "ugi".
