The xdgdqc factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the eapq factor and has three levels: "bidy", "qzjjv", and "wpjoz". If the eapq two trials back is "adm" and the eapq on the previous trial is not "adm", then the trial is considered a "bidy". If the eapq two trials back is not "adm" and the eapq on the previous trial is "hrtrsx", then the trial is considered a "qzjjv". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "wpjoz".
