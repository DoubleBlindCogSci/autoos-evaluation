The rvdi factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the yctm factor and has two levels: "uqzei" and "zlku". If the yctm on the previous trial is not "vhew" and the yctm on the current trial is "akgbzo", then the trial is considered a "uqzei". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "zlku".
