The knikh factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the fmxd factor and has three levels: "wnlbw", "hsdr", and "nykz". If the fmxd on the previous trial is "hcosa" and the fmxd on the current trial is not "hcosa", then the trial is "wnlbw". If the fmxd on the previous trial is not "hcosa" and the fmxd on the current trial is "maa", then the trial is "hsdr". Otherwise, the trial is "nykz".
