The orl factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the ouggqp, eylw, and iji factors. It has two levels: "jteux" and "oknyrj". If the ouggqp on the current trial matches the eylw two trials back, then the trial is considered a "jteux". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "oknyrj".
