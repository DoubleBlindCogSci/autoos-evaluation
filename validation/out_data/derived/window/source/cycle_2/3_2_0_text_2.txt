The otzpw factor depends on the tjqjy and tclqkw factors and has three levels: "dkytkh", "vfz", and "hizcf". It depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the tjqjy and tclqkw factors. If the tjqjy on the current trial is "lxhb" and the tclqkw two trials back is not "scals", then the trial is "dkytkh". If the tjqjy on the current trial is not "lxhb" and the tclqkw two trials back is "scals", then the trial is "vfz". Otherwise, the trial is "hizcf".
