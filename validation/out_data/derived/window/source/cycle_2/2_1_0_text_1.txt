The koux factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the jux factor and has two levels: "nct" and "xfgem". If the jux on the previous trial is not "oxp" or the jux on the current trial is not "jvpa", then the trial is considered a "nct". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "xfgem".
