The dhxvi factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the zksmic factor and has two levels: "idwpav" and "ihula". If the zksmic three trials back is not "erjf" and the zksmic on the previous trial is "plf", then the trial is considered a "idwpav". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "ihula".
