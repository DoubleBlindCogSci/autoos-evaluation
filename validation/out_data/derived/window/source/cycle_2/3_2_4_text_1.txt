The hxtank factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the tgyp and izn factors and has three levels: "zvo", "fhvwfc", and "bxig". If the tgyp three trials back is "wsa" and the izn is not "vmc", then the trial is "zvo". If the tgyp three trials back is not "wsa" and the izn is "vmc", then the trial is "fhvwfc". Otherwise, the trial is "bxig".
