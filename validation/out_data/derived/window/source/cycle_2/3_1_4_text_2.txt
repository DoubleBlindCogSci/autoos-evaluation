The cfa factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the sdlbze factor and has three levels: "nrzh", "hyzlfw", and "osuagf". If the sdlbze three trials back is "gar" and the sdlbze on the previous trial is not "gar", then the trial is considered a "nrzh". If the sdlbze three trials back is not "gar" and the sdlbze on the previous trial is "aduc", then the trial is considered a "hyzlfw". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "osuagf".
