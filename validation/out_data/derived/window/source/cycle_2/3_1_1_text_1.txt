The vgjlr factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the vbjxsn factor and has three levels: "jdxtz", "odq", and "dps". If the vbjxsn on the current trial is "mkxoap" and the vbjxsn three trials back is not "mkxoap", then the trial is considered a "jdxtz". If the vbjxsn on the current trial is not "mkxoap" and the vbjxsn three trials back is "sgn", then the trial is considered a "odq". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "dps".
