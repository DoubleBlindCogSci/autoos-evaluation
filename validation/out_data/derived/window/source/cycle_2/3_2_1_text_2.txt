The url factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the eqhxp and fkxb factors and has three levels: "tmu", "qdhzdb", and "qkejh". If the eqhxp on the current trial is "etz" and the fkxb on the previous trial is not "teif", then the trial is considered a "tmu". If the eqhxp on the current trial is not "etz" and the fkxb on the previous trial is "teif", then the trial is considered a "qdhzdb". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "qkejh".
