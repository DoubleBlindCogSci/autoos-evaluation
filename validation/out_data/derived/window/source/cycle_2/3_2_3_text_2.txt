The jwu factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the llppou and buff factors and has three levels: "odx", "eqe", and "qygv". If the llppou on the current trial is "pmvgq" and the buff on the previous trial is not "rawjzc", then the trial is considered a "odx". If the llppou on the current trial is not "pmvgq" and the buff on the previous trial is "rawjzc", then the trial is considered a "eqe". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "qygv".
