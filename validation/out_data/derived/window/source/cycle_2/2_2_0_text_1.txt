The rqjuv factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the rdt and ilf factors. It has two levels: "lpvlp" and "uiqx". If the rdt on the current trial is not "jgpw" or the ilf on the current trial is not "qhas", then the trial is considered "lpvlp". Otherwise, the trial is considered "uiqx".
