The gwyg factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the ldl factor and has two levels: "roopgk" and "ehauj". If the ldl on the previous trial is not "xtgz" and the ldl on the current trial is not "ecs", then the trial is considered "roopgk". Otherwise, the trial is considered "ehauj".
