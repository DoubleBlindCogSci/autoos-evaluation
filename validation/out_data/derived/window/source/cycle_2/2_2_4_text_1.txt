The qdcu factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the udcne and ayqf factors and has two levels: "ougyxb" and "okdoat". If the udcne on the previous trial is "rncyt" and the ayqf three trials back is not "rgqja", then the trial is considered a "ougyxb". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "okdoat".
