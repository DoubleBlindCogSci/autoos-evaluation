The tmvjq factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the tdnox factor and has three levels: "uto", "ifontz", and "ntqamr". If the tdnox two trials back is "hrotnx" and the tdnox three trials back is not "hrotnx", then the trial is "uto". If the tdnox two trials back is not "hrotnx" and the tdnox three trials back is "qacp", then the trial is "ifontz". If the tdnox two trials back is not "hrotnx" and the tdnox three trials back is not "qacp", then the trial is "ntqamr".
