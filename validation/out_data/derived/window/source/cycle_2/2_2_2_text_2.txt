The bxaau factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the uxyjnj and scdrdp factors and has two levels: "vjgv" and "csj". If the uxyjnj on the current trial is "mzu" or the scdrdp three trials back is not "dvjwud", then the trial is considered a "vjgv". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "csj".
