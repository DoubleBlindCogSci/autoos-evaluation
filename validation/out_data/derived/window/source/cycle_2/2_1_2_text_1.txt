The mktqr factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the vinn factor and has two levels: "iyflel" and "hnojgz". If the vinn three trials back is not "ocg" or the vinn two trials back is "eixzwg", then the trial is considered a "iyflel". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "hnojgz".
