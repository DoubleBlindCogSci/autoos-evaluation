The ewfej factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the mcfe factor and has three levels: "jozju", "tozb", and "qpbcog". If the mcfe three trials back is "jjuu" and the mcfe on the current trial is not "jjuu", then the trial is considered a "jozju". If the mcfe three trials back is not "jjuu" and the mcfe on the current trial is "cjd", then the trial is considered a "tozb". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "qpbcog".
