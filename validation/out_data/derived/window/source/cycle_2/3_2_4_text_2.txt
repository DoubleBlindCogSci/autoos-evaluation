The hxtank factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the tgyp and izn factors and has three levels: "zvo", "fhvwfc", and "bxig". If the tgyp three trials back is "wsa" and the izn is not "vmc", then the trial is considered a "zvo". If the tgyp three trials back is not "wsa" and the izn is "vmc", then the trial is considered a "fhvwfc". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "bxig".
