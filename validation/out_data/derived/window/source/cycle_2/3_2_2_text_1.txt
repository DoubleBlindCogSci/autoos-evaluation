The gas factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the xmbiq and pap factors and has three levels: "zcp", "mnoor", and "rhx". If the xmbiq on the previous trial is "xqojg" and the pap three trials back is not "lcnfur", then the trial is considered a "zcp". If the xmbiq on the previous trial is not "xqojg" and the pap three trials back is "lcnfur", then the trial is considered a "mnoor". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "rhx".
