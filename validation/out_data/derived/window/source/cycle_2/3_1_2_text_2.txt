The jkfrap factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the phpbdt factor and has three levels: "lsy", "fxiti", and "aydm". If the phpbdt two trials back is "kvd" and the phpbdt on the previous trial is not "kvd", then the trial is considered a "lsy". If the phpbdt two trials back is not "kvd" and the phpbdt on the previous trial is "zlfa", then the trial is considered a "fxiti". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "aydm".
