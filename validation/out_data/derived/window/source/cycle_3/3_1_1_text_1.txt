The bxt factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the med factor and has three levels: "hurev", "axe", and "tuaxow". If the med two trials back is "fbcolf" and the med on the previous trial is not "fbcolf", then the trial is "hurev". If the med two trials back is not "fbcolf" and the med on the previous trial is "enhw", then the trial is "axe". Otherwise, the trial is "tuaxow".
