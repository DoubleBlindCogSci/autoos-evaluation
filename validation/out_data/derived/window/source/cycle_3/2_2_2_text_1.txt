The xai factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the yemhmd, fhpxgk, and hbf factors and has two levels: "ejfrf" and "ytxwau". If the yemhmd three trials back is not the same as the hbf two trials back, then the trial is considered a "ejfrf". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "ytxwau".
