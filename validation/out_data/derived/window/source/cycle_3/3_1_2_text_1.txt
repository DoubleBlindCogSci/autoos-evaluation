The gfws factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the roi factor and has three levels: "unzl", "wugp", and "quuxfe". If the roi on the current trial is "fdzye" and the roi three trials back is not "fdzye", then the trial is considered a "unzl". If the roi on the current trial is not "fdzye" and the roi three trials back is "lgvbd", then the trial is considered a "wugp". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "quuxfe".
