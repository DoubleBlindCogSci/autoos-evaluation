The fek factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the xcgfv factor and has three levels: "lbxs", "wacr", and "gvvjvb". If the xcgfv three trials back is "vjlc" and the xcgfv on the current trial is not "vjlc", then the trial is "lbxs". If the xcgfv three trials back is not "vjlc" and the xcgfv on the current trial is "qayz", then the trial is "wacr". Otherwise, the trial is "gvvjvb".
