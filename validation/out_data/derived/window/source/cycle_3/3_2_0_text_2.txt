The faobo factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the jfmjpo, krk, and ktn factors. It has three levels: "uqcsr", "nrzqy", and "bzlj". If the jfmjpo three trials back matches the ktn on the current trial and the jfmjpo on the previous trial does not match the krk three trials back, then the trial is "uqcsr". If the ktn on the current trial does not match the jfmjpo three trials back and the krk three trials back matches the jfmjpo on the previous trial, then the trial is "nrzqy". Otherwise, the trial is "bzlj".
