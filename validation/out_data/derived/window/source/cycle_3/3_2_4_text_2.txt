The qykga factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the sfjmyp, upld, and wroo factors. It has three levels: "kkgk", "jpv", and "wzrc". If the sfjmyp on the current trial matches the wroo two trials back and the sfjmyp two trials back does not match the upld on the current trial, then the trial is "kkgk". If the wroo two trials back does not match the sfjmyp on the current trial and the sfjmyp two trials back matches the upld on the current trial, then the trial is "jpv". Otherwise, the trial is "wzrc".
