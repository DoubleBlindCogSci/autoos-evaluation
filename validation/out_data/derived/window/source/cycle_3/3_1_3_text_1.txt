The jpu factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the myriv factor and has three levels: "tkiu", "nxmsiz", and "nandlu". If the myriv two trials back is "rix" and the myriv on the current trial is not "rix", then the trial is considered a "tkiu". If the myriv two trials back is not "rix" and the myriv on the current trial is "czbk", then the trial is considered a "nxmsiz". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "nandlu".
