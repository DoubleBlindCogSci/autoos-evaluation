The reyloi factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the inm, qcbti, and rmwf factors. It has three levels: "ovxpz", "ojx", and "akwq". If the rmwf on the previous trial is the same as the inm on the current trial and the inm on the previous trial is not the same as the qcbti on the current trial, then the trial is "ovxpz". If the rmwf on the previous trial is not the same as the inm on the current trial and the qcbti on the current trial is the same as the inm on the previous trial, then the trial is "ojx". Otherwise, the trial is "akwq".
