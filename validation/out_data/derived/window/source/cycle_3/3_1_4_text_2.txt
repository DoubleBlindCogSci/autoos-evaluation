The fek factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the xcgfv factor and has three levels: "lbxs", "wacr", and "gvvjvb". If the xcgfv three trials back is "vjlc" and the xcgfv on the current trial is not "vjlc", then the trial is considered a "lbxs". If the xcgfv three trials back is not "vjlc" and the xcgfv on the current trial is "qayz", then the trial is considered a "wacr". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "gvvjvb".
