The svpnhe factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the xzar and fnhg factors. It has three levels: "vkj", "xkghzg", and "dxo". If the xzar on the previous trial is "jhpjrv" and the fnhg two trials back is not "zigtjm", then the trial is "vkj". If the xzar on the previous trial is not "jhpjrv" and the fnhg two trials back is "zigtjm", then the trial is "xkghzg". Otherwise, the trial is "dxo".
