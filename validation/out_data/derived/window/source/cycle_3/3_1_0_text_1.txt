The samck factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the wjnax factor and has three levels: "noxy", "joc", and "bwit". If the wjnax on the current trial is "xmrrwb" and the wjnax three trials back is not "xmrrwb", then the trial is considered a "noxy". If the wjnax on the current trial is not "xmrrwb" and the wjnax three trials back is "vncl", then the trial is considered a "joc". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "bwit".
