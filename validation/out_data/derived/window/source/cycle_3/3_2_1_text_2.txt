The xyye factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the dnra and hxqdn factors and has three levels: "cigu", "lyc", and "ewzu". If the dnra on the current trial is "xnah" and the hxqdn three trials back is not "hevlrn", then the trial is considered a "cigu". If the dnra on the current trial is not "xnah" and the hxqdn three trials back is "hevlrn", then the trial is considered a "lyc". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "ewzu".
