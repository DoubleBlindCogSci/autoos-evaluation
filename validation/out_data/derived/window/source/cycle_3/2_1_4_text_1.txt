The aizxw factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the hsva factor and has two levels: "okb" and "atvuk". If the hsva on the current trial is not "wghwmg" or the hsva on the previous trial is not "ksmtfw", then the trial is considered a "okb". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "atvuk".
