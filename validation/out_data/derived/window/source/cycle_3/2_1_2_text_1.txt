The byjy factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the ybxlxi factor and has two levels: "jlkvr" and "hlpzh". If the ybxlxi two trials back is "zlobz" or the ybxlxi three trials back is "kauhfp", then the trial is considered a "jlkvr". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "hlpzh".
