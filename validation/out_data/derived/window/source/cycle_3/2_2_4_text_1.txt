The kultts factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last three trials) defined by the jzn, ehon, and xtzkge factors and has two levels: "wrn" and "yrit". If the jzn two trials back matches the xtzkge on the current trial and the jzn on the current trial does not match the ehon two trials back, then the trial is considered a "wrn". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "yrit".
