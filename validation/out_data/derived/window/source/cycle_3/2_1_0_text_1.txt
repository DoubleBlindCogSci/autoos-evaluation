The mhjwrc factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last four trials) defined by the qozaj factor and has two levels: "purf" and "nkjhjd". If the qozaj on the previous trial is not "npbmju" and the qozaj three trials back is not "aje", then the trial is considered a "purf". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "nkjhjd".
