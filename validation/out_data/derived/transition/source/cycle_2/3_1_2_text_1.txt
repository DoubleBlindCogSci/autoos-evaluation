The hrsqjf factor depends on the transition of the mes factor and has three levels: "hvrwc", "fhi", and "oxtbkp". If the mes on the previous trial is "hbj" and the mes on the current trial is not "fgar", then the trial is considered a "hvrwc". If the mes on the previous trial is "hbj" and the mes on the current trial is "fgar", then the trial is considered a "fhi". Otherwise, the trial is considered an "oxtbkp".
