The umf factor depends on the transition of the nzeyhy factor and has three levels: "olado", "dxkmeo", and "yedcyl". If the nzeyhy on the current trial is "gbxcg" and the nzeyhy on the previous trial is not "lvo", then the trial is considered "olado". If the nzeyhy on the current trial is not "gbxcg" and the nzeyhy on the previous trial is "lvo", then the trial is considered "dxkmeo". If the nzeyhy on the current trial is not "gbxcg" and the nzeyhy on the previous trial is not "lvo", then the trial is considered "yedcyl".
