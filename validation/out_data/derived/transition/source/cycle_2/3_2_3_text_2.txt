The cij factor depends on the transition of the vzweak, dsrncz, and nwdg factors and has three levels: "gkutnp", "qpmdhc", and "ezj". If the dsrncz on the previous trial matches the vzweak on the current trial and the vzweak on the previous trial does not match the nwdg on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "gkutnp". If the dsrncz on the previous trial does not match the vzweak on the current trial and the vzweak on the previous trial matches the nwdg on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "qpmdhc". Otherwise, the trial is considered an "ezj".
