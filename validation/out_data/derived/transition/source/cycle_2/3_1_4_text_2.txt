The klc factor depends on the transition of the rwkex factor and has three levels: "ufpf", "lrbn", and "mwop". If the rwkex on the current trial is "hlyauw" and the rwkex on the previous trial is not "lis", then the trial is considered a "ufpf". If the rwkex on the current trial is not "hlyauw" and the rwkex on the previous trial is "lis", then the trial is considered a "lrbn". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "mwop".
