The srpb factor depends on the transition of the zfr, whs, and amxjcp factors and has three levels: "ahjve", "wtj", and "oasw". If the zfr on the current trial matches the whs on the previous trial and the zfr on the previous trial does not match the amxjcp on the current trial, then the trial is considered "ahjve". If the whs on the previous trial does not match the zfr on the current trial and the amxjcp on the current trial matches the zfr on the previous trial, then the trial is considered "wtj". Otherwise, the trial is considered "oasw".
