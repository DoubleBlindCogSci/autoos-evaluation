The sfk factor depends on the transition of the fum factor and has three levels: "gthv", "lyd", and "ctzx". If the fum on the current trial is "nfueqd" and the fum on the previous trial is not "otqv", then the trial is "gthv". If the fum on the current trial is not "nfueqd" and the fum on the previous trial is "otqv", then the trial is "lyd". Otherwise, the trial is "ctzx".
