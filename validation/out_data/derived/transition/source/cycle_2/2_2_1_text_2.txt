The paqaim factor depends on the transition of the ppo, vjsf, and utvdc factors and has two levels: "szx" and "dvcood". If the ppo on the current trial is different from the utvdc on the previous trial and the ppo on the previous trial is the same as the vjsf on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "szx". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "dvcood".
