The ofltsk factor depends on the transition of the ldg, kjsz, and anepf factors and has two levels: "qzcn" and "bboag". If the ldg on the current trial is not equal to the anepf on the previous trial and the ldg on the previous trial is equal to the kjsz on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "qzcn". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "bboag".
