The srpb factor depends on the transition of the zfr, whs, and amxjcp factors and has three levels: "ahjve", "wtj", and "oasw". If the zfr on the current trial is equal to the whs on the previous trial and the zfr on the previous trial is not equal to the amxjcp on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "ahjve". If the whs on the previous trial is not equal to the zfr on the current trial and the amxjcp on the current trial is equal to the zfr on the previous trial, then the trial is considered a "wtj". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "oasw".
