The pnlg factor depends on the transition of the ljajs and duebpi factors and has three levels: "vpbr", "kwcroh", and "gtkpx". If the ljajs on the previous trial is "mgg" and the duebpi on the current trial is not "dpbx", then the trial is considered a "vpbr". If the ljajs on the previous trial is not "mgg" and the duebpi on the current trial is "dpbx", then the trial is considered a "kwcroh". If the ljajs on the previous trial is not "mgg" and the duebpi on the current trial is not "dpbx", then the trial is considered a "gtkpx".
