The edud factor depends on the transition of the rtbca and zxtt factors and has three levels: "hbbs", "slsizl", and "swgha". If the rtbca on the previous trial is "ibf" and the zxtt on the current trial is not "wlran", then the trial is considered a "hbbs". If the rtbca on the previous trial is not "ibf" and the zxtt on the current trial is "wlran", then the trial is considered a "slsizl". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "swgha".
