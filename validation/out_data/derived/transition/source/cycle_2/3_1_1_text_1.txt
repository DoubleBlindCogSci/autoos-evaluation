The fnugna factor depends on the transition of the spa factor and has three levels: "uudtil", "pvec", and "aeshf". If the spa on the previous trial is "iuy" and the spa on the current trial is not "gioiz", then the trial is considered a "uudtil". If the spa on the previous trial is not "iuy" and the spa on the current trial is "gioiz", then the trial is considered a "pvec". Otherwise, the trial is considered an "aeshf".
