The gutkwe factor depends on the transition of the szoeft, dgtvts, and illdc factors and has three levels: "bywbjl", "feucje", and "yawb". If the szoeft on the current trial matches the dgtvts on the previous trial and the szoeft on the previous trial does not match the illdc on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "bywbjl". If the dgtvts on the previous trial does not match the szoeft on the current trial and the szoeft on the previous trial matches the illdc on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "feucje". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "yawb".
