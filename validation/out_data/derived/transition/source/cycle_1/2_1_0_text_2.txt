The qcq factor has two levels: "yhhwqh" and "war". It depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the ogsg factor. If the ogsg on the current trial is "uvjxds" and the ogsg on the previous trial is not "surzu", then the trial is considered a "yhhwqh". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "war".
