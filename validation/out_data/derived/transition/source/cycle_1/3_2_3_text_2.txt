The itia factor has three levels: "zphjm", "cgtyi", and "ugeqmm". It depends on the transition of the dwrpg and ossys factors. If the dwrpg factor on the current trial is "kjdt", then the trial is considered a "zphjm". If the dwrpg factor on the current trial is not "kjdt" and the ossys factor on the current trial is "juns", then the trial is considered a "cgtyi". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "ugeqmm".
