The npswlj factor has two levels: "tmgjgv" and "ttx". It depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the szaa factor. If the szaa on the current trial is "wea" and the szaa on the previous trial is "ziyrmo", then the trial is considered a "tmgjgv". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "ttx".
