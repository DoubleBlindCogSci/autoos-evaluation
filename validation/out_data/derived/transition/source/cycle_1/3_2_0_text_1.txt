The wjjh factor depends on the transition of the cridpl, fra, and sqhrna factors and has three levels: "vek", "nfgszz", and "fckuoh". If the fra on the current trial is the same as the cridpl on the previous trial, then the trial is considered a "vek". If the fra on the current trial is not the same as the cridpl on the previous trial and the cridpl on the current trial is the same as the sqhrna on the previous trial, then the trial is considered a "nfgszz". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "fckuoh".
