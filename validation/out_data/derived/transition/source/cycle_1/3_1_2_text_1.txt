The ylw factor depends on the transition of the jqnhlp factor and has three levels: "vszfo", "bqhaz", and "ugwna". If the jqnhlp on the current trial is "ojnya", then the trial is considered a "vszfo". If the jqnhlp on the current trial is "mjsx", then the trial is considered a "bqhaz". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "ugwna".
