The rew factor depends on the transition of the pbdufo and bij factors and has three levels: "cjl", "zfzme", and "ipcih". If the pbdufo on the current trial is "bvs", then the trial is considered a "cjl". If the pbdufo on the current trial is not "bvs" and the bij on the current trial is "ssvls", then the trial is considered a "zfzme". Otherwise, the trial is considered an "ipcih".
