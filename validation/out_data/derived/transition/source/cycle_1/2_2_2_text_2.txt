The nhhng factor depends on the transition of the ljyd, fxklzn, and wykjm factors and has two levels: "ubgi" and "tiggrl". If the ljyd factor on the current trial is not equal to the wykjm factor on the previous trial or if the ljyd factor on the current trial is equal to the fxklzn factor on the previous trial, then the trial is considered "ubgi". Otherwise, the trial is considered "tiggrl".
