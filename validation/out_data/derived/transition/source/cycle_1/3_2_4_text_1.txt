The fjl factor depends on the transition of the kekvlw, fpcf, and cbbiqs factors and has three levels: "iwbpyw", "drcljo", and "jxgp". If the cbbiqs on the current trial is equal to the kekvlw on the previous trial, then the trial is considered an "iwbpyw". If the cbbiqs on the current trial is not equal to the kekvlw on the previous trial and the fpcf on the current trial is equal to the kekvlw on the previous trial, then the trial is considered a "drcljo". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "jxgp".
