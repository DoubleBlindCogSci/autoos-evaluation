The etwf factor depends on the transition of the vksj factor and has three levels: "pkxzmq", "aman", and "zuttft". If the vksj on the current trial is "cfohyl", then the trial is considered a "pkxzmq". If the vksj on the current trial is "quu", then the trial is considered an "aman". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "zuttft".
