The goetv factor depends on the transition of the iraw factor and has three levels: "luve", "wxp", and "zjqnkh". If the iraw on the current trial is "ofd", then the trial is considered a "luve". If the iraw on the current trial is "uyv", then the trial is considered a "wxp". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "zjqnkh".
