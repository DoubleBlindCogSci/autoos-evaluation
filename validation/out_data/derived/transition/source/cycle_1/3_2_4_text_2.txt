The fjl factor depends on the transition of the cbbiqs, kekvlw, and fpcf factors and has three levels: "iwbpyw", "drcljo", and "jxgp". If the cbbiqs factor on the current trial matches the kekvlw factor on the previous trial, then the trial is considered an "iwbpyw". If the cbbiqs factor on the current trial does not match the kekvlw factor on the previous trial and the fpcf factor on the current trial matches the kekvlw factor on the previous trial, then the trial is considered a "drcljo". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "jxgp".
