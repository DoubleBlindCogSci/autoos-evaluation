The nxqa factor depends on the transition of the duxbo, cbrnt, and rep factors and has three levels: "xbata", "qzxb", and "bfl". If the cbrnt on the current trial is the same as the duxbo on the previous trial, then the trial is considered "xbata". If the cbrnt on the current trial is not the same as the duxbo on the previous trial and the rep on the current trial is the same as the duxbo on the previous trial, then the trial is considered "qzxb". Otherwise, the trial is considered "bfl".
