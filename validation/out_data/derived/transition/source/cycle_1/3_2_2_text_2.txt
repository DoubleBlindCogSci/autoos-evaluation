The nxqa factor depends on the transition of the cbrnt and duxbo factors and has three levels: "xbata", "qzxb", and "bfl". If the cbrnt on the current trial matches the duxbo on the previous trial, then the trial is considered "xbata". If the cbrnt on the current trial does not match the duxbo on the previous trial and the rep on the current trial matches the duxbo on the previous trial, then the trial is considered "qzxb". Otherwise, the trial is considered "bfl".
