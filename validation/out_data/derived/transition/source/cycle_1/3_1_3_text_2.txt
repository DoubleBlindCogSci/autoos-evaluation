The youocf factor depends on the transition of the ghljns factor and has three levels: "ery", "ltxz", and "kybpzi". If the ghljns on the current trial is "sassnr", then the trial is considered an "ery". If the ghljns on the current trial is "tgxq", then the trial is considered a "ltxz". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "kybpzi".
