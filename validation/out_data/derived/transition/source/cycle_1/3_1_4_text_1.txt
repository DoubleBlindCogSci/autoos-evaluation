The zhyw factor depends on the transition of the wsle factor and has three levels: "zldik", "oflt", and "ziowfh". If the wsle on the current trial is "sorijz", then the trial is considered a "zldik". If the wsle on the current trial is "jerlq", then the trial is considered a "oflt". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "ziowfh".
