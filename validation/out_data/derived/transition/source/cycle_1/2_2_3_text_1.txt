The oum factor depends on the transition of the cfgp and zotx factors and has two levels: "uhrgs" and "vrqyuv". If the cfgp factor on the current trial is not "yadxcf" and the zotx factor on the current trial is not "ldmd", then the trial is considered "uhrgs". Otherwise, the trial is considered "vrqyuv".
