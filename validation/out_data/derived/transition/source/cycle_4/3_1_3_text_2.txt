The gkzn factor depends on the transition of the kgtk factor and has three levels: "pyxd", "dlyye", and "yydfj". If the kgtk on the current trial is "sfyyo" and the kgtk on the previous trial is not "rgved", then the trial is considered a "pyxd". If the kgtk on the current trial is not "sfyyo" and the kgtk on the previous trial is "rgved", then the trial is considered a "dlyye". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "yydfj".
