The zbhiv factor depends on the transition of the jmz and sqg factors and has three levels: "puhii", "wdcu", and "kwuqg". If the jmz on the previous trial is "jihy" and the sqg on the current trial is not "xtn", then the trial is considered a "puhii". If the jmz on the previous trial is not "jihy" and the sqg on the current trial is "xtn", then the trial is considered a "wdcu". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "kwuqg".
