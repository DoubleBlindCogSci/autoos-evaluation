The ybt factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the swxrom and hfo factors and has three levels: "asygc", "cgb", and "chx". If the swxrom on the previous trial is "cwqp" and the hfo on the current trial is not "uukbjl", then the trial is considered "asygc". If the swxrom on the previous trial is not "cwqp" and the hfo on the current trial is "uukbjl", then the trial is considered "cgb". Otherwise, the trial is considered "chx".
