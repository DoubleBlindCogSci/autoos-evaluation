The zraiw factor depends on the transition of the pkhem factor and has three levels: "baghw", "nadv", and "jonu". If the pkhem on the current trial is "skiq" and the pkhem on the previous trial is not "kigd", then the trial is "baghw". If the pkhem on the current trial is not "skiq" and the pkhem on the previous trial is "kigd", then the trial is "nadv". Otherwise, the trial is "jonu".
