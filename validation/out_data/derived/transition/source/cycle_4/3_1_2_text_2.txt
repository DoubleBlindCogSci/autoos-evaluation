The jofvzx factor depends on the transition of the hxtk factor and has three levels: "xzyabw", "fqpfw", and "cacgyf". If the hxtk on the current trial is "iqjrov" and the hxtk on the previous trial is not "jood", then the trial is considered a "xzyabw". If the hxtk on the current trial is not "iqjrov" and the hxtk on the previous trial is "jood", then the trial is considered a "fqpfw". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "cacgyf".
