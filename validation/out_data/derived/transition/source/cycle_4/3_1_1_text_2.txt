The qrrz factor depends on the transition of the pzapf factor and has three levels: "ehmlbs", "aisbii", and "irhh". If the pzapf on the current trial is "fpmsni" and the pzapf on the previous trial is not "ieem", then the trial is considered a "ehmlbs". If the pzapf on the current trial is not "fpmsni" and the pzapf on the previous trial is "ieem", then the trial is considered a "aisbii". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "irhh".
