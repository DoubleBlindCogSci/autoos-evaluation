The zraiw factor depends on the transition of the pkhem factor and has three levels: "baghw", "nadv", and "jonu". If the pkhem on the current trial is "skiq" and the pkhem on the previous trial is not "kigd", then the trial is considered a "baghw". If the pkhem on the current trial is not "skiq" and the pkhem on the previous trial is "kigd", then the trial is considered a "nadv". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "jonu".
