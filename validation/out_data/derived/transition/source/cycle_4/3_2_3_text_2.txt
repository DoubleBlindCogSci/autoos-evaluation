The tqfiyn factor depends on the transition of the hcwy, mhcn, and wnsekp factors and has three levels: "poqmg", "vgrgin", and "wxp". If the mhcn on the previous trial matches the hcwy on the current trial and the hcwy on the previous trial does not match the wnsekp on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "poqmg". If the mhcn on the previous trial does not match the hcwy on the current trial and the hcwy on the previous trial matches the wnsekp on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "vgrgin". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "wxp".
