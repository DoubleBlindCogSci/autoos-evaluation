The nfx factor depends on the transition of the jvsf factor and has three levels: "tngyia", "gemffy", and "sspc". If the jvsf on the current trial is "xae" and the jvsf on the previous trial is not "rtxaw", then the trial is considered a "tngyia". If the jvsf on the current trial is not "xae" and the jvsf on the previous trial is "rtxaw", then the trial is considered a "gemffy". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "sspc".
