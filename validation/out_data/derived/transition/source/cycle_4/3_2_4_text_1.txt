The ybt factor depends on a moving trial window (for the last two trials) defined by the swxrom and hfo factors. It has three levels: "asygc", "cgb", and "chx". If the swxrom on the previous trial is "cwqp" and the hfo on the current trial is not "uukbjl", then the trial is considered a "asygc". If the swxrom on the previous trial is not "cwqp" and the hfo on the current trial is "uukbjl", then the trial is considered a "cgb". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "chx".
