The zbhiv factor depends on the transition of the jmz and sqg factors and has three levels: "puhii", "wdcu", and "kwuqg". If the jmz on the previous trial is "jihy" and the sqg on the current trial is not "xtn", then the trial is "puhii". If the jmz on the previous trial is not "jihy" and the sqg on the current trial is "xtn", then the trial is "wdcu". Otherwise, the trial is "kwuqg".
