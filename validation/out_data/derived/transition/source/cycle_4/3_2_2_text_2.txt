The sjkko factor depends on the transition of the guy and ooagz factors and has three levels: "cmidw", "fncgbm", and "ila". If the guy on the previous trial is "egjb" and the ooagz on the current trial is not "cxkdhe", then the trial is considered a "cmidw". If the guy on the previous trial is not "egjb" and the ooagz on the current trial is "cxkdhe", then the trial is considered a "fncgbm". Otherwise, the trial is considered an "ila".
