The ucdmr factor depends on the transition of the cllom, dqbabm, and hvd factors and has three levels: "vcllmd", "kvhw", and "zkoh". If the dqbabm on the previous trial matches the cllom on the current trial and the cllom on the previous trial does not match the hvd on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "vcllmd". If the dqbabm on the previous trial does not match the cllom on the current trial and the cllom on the previous trial matches the hvd on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "kvhw". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "zkoh".
