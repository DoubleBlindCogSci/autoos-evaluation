The urgjg factor depends on the transition of the zgzyu, myuanw, and mpvcn factors and has two levels: "eqi" and "cqtu". If the zgzyu on the current trial is not equal to the mpvcn on the previous trial and the zgzyu on the current trial is not equal to the myuanw on the previous trial, then the trial is considered "eqi". Otherwise, the trial is considered "cqtu".
