The takwli factor depends on the transition of the coowtg factor and has three levels: "amqeea", "czmiqp", and "cxhs". If the coowtg on the current trial is "vzr" and the coowtg on the previous trial is not "ssplw", then the trial is considered "amqeea". If the coowtg on the current trial is not "vzr" and the coowtg on the previous trial is "ssplw", then the trial is considered "czmiqp". Otherwise, the trial is considered "cxhs".
