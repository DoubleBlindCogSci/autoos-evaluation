The lpnq factor depends on the transition of the xatn factor and has three levels: "ftgjj", "byul", and "wuzutq". If the xatn on the current trial is "rhk" and the xatn on the previous trial is not "zqjdqg", then the trial is considered a "ftgjj". If the xatn on the current trial is not "rhk" and the xatn on the previous trial is "zqjdqg", then the trial is considered a "byul". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "wuzutq".
