The eqm factor depends on the transition of the hstuwb and zfln factors and has three levels: "fbhrc", "thwl", and "ixo". If the hstuwb on the previous trial is "slzolh" and the zfln on the current trial is not "ydiyqj", then the trial is considered a "fbhrc". If the hstuwb on the previous trial is not "slzolh" and the zfln on the current trial is "ydiyqj", then the trial is considered a "thwl". Otherwise, the trial is considered an "ixo".
