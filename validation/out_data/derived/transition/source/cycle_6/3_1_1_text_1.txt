The uwmv factor depends on the transition of the hwcri factor and has three levels: "duaqe", "axiti", and "cco". If the hwcri on the current trial is "kwxymw" and the hwcri on the previous trial is not "xgg", then the trial is "duaqe". If the hwcri on the current trial is not "kwxymw" and the hwcri on the previous trial is "xgg", then the trial is "axiti". Otherwise, the trial is "cco".
