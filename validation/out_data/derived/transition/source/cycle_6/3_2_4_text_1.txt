The gaovt factor depends on the transition of the wnjfo, ydczl, and ezw factors and has three levels: "wpyds", "hjm", and "iiyv". If the ydczl on the previous trial is equal to the wnjfo on the current trial and the wnjfo on the previous trial is not equal to the ezw on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "wpyds". If the ydczl on the previous trial is not equal to the wnjfo on the current trial and the wnjfo on the previous trial is equal to the ezw on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "hjm". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "iiyv".
