The gaovt factor depends on the transition of the ydczl, wnjfo, and ezw factors and has three levels: "wpyds", "hjm", and "iiyv". If the ydczl on the previous trial matches the wnjfo on the current trial and the wnjfo on the previous trial does not match the ezw on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "wpyds". If the ydczl on the previous trial does not match the wnjfo on the current trial and the wnjfo on the previous trial matches the ezw on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "hjm". Otherwise, the trial is considered an "iiyv".
