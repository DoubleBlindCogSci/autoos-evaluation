The jkq factor depends on the transition of the chim, qtz, and mies factors and has two levels: "wfa" and "phgv". If the chim on the current trial matches the mies on the previous trial or the chim on the previous trial matches the qtz on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "wfa". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "phgv".
