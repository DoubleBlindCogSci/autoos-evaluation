The lqi factor depends on the transition of the zper, gjueol, and folsmk factors and has two levels: "qvi" and "lqn". If the zper on the current trial matches the gjueol on the previous trial and the zper on the previous trial does not match the folsmk on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "qvi". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "lqn".
