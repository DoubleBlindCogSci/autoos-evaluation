The kuuz factor depends on the transition of the wov factor and has three levels: "kgwv", "jxl", and "sfam". If the wov on the previous trial is "lgit" and the wov on the current trial is not "wxcyas", then the trial is "kgwv". If the wov on the previous trial is not "lgit" and the wov on the current trial is "wxcyas", then the trial is "jxl". Otherwise, the trial is "sfam".
