The xtw factor depends on the transition of the hwdb and gderh factors and has three levels: "rjw", "wze", and "iygzzo". If the hwdb on the previous trial is "eoxdtw" and the gderh on the current trial is not "mxgf", then the trial is considered a "rjw". If the hwdb on the previous trial is not "eoxdtw" and the gderh on the current trial is "mxgf", then the trial is considered a "wze". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "iygzzo".
