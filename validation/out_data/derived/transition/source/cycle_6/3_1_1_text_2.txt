The uwmv factor depends on the transition of the hwcri factor and has three levels: "duaqe", "axiti", and "cco". If the hwcri on the current trial is "kwxymw" and the hwcri on the previous trial is not "xgg", then the trial is considered a "duaqe". If the hwcri on the current trial is not "kwxymw" and the hwcri on the previous trial is "xgg", then the trial is considered an "axiti". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "cco".
