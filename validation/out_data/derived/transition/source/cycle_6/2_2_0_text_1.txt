The hsus factor depends on the transition of the yqdhvs, jfb, and zepq factors and has two levels: "jhu" and "fxycq". If the yqdhvs on the current trial is not equal to the jfb on the previous trial or the yqdhvs on the previous trial is not equal to the zepq on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "jhu". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "fxycq".
