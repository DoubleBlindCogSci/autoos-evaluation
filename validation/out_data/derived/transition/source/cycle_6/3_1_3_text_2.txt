The kuuz factor depends on the transition of the wov factor and has three levels: "kgwv", "jxl", and "sfam". If the wov on the previous trial is "lgit" and the wov on the current trial is not "wxcyas", then the trial is considered a "kgwv". If the wov on the previous trial is not "lgit" and the wov on the current trial is "wxcyas", then the trial is considered a "jxl". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "sfam".
