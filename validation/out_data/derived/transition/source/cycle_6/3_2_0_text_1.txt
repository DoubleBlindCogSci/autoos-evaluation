The mbgo factor depends on the transition of the bzz, wuan, and tbbie factors and has three levels: "kavhih", "ytt", and "wcaqvo". If the bzz on the current trial matches the wuan on the previous trial and the bzz on the previous trial does not match the tbbie on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "kavhih". If the wuan on the previous trial does not match the bzz on the current trial and the bzz on the previous trial matches the tbbie on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "ytt". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "wcaqvo".
