The jljwku factor depends on the transition of the vyl and lytpda factors and has three levels: "zigcr", "ltkzxi", and "xinlkr". If the vyl on the previous trial is "omuphx" and the lytpda on the current trial is not "uqjxcp", then the trial is considered a "zigcr". If the vyl on the previous trial is not "omuphx" and the lytpda on the current trial is "uqjxcp", then the trial is considered a "ltkzxi". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "xinlkr".
