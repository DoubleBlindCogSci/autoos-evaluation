The dirfp factor depends on the transition of the axxxy factor and has three levels: "ksw", "sjt", and "flwqk". If the axxxy on the current trial is "vxrjpm" and the axxxy on the previous trial is not "hgte", then the trial is "ksw". If the axxxy on the current trial is not "vxrjpm" and the axxxy on the previous trial is "hgte", then the trial is "sjt". Otherwise, the trial is "flwqk".
