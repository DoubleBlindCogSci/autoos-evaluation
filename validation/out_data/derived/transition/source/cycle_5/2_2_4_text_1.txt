The sealv factor depends on the transition of the nzl, xmiax, and vtzuv factors and has two levels: "hpwaa" and "sryzex". If the nzl on the current trial is not equal to the vtzuv on the previous trial or the nzl on the previous trial is not equal to the xmiax on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "hpwaa". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "sryzex".
