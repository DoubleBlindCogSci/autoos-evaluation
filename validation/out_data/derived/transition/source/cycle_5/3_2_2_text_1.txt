The qfzc factor depends on the transition of the cyovro, qoyk, and zjgjio factors and has three levels: "pgc", "efgfn", and "avaxq". If the qoyk on the previous trial matches the cyovro on the current trial and the cyovro on the previous trial does not match the zjgjio on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "pgc". If the qoyk on the previous trial does not match the cyovro on the current trial and the cyovro on the previous trial matches the zjgjio on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "efgfn". If the qoyk on the previous trial does not match the cyovro on the current trial and the cyovro on the previous trial does not match the zjgjio on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "avaxq".
