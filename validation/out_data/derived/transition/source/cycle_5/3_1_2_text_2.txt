The uakm factor depends on the transition of the gux factor and has three levels: "prbuti", "gstiro", and "wjb". If the gux on the previous trial is "fwe" and the gux on the current trial is not "gwta", then the trial is considered a "prbuti". If the gux on the previous trial is not "fwe" and the gux on the current trial is "gwta", then the trial is considered a "gstiro". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "wjb".
