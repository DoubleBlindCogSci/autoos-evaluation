The norzp factor depends on the transition of the hibrnw factor and has three levels: "ysu", "ovfnl", and "nfyhcz". If the hibrnw on the current trial is "blomac" and the hibrnw on the previous trial is not "hdhoy", then the trial is "ysu". If the hibrnw on the current trial is "hdhoy" and the hibrnw on the previous trial is "blomac", then the trial is "ovfnl". If the hibrnw on the current trial is not "blomac" and the hibrnw on the previous trial is not "hdhoy", then the trial is "nfyhcz".
