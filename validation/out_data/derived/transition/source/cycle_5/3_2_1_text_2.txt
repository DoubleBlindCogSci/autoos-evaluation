The vkv factor depends on the transition of the mkepe, ytw, and nbv factors and has three levels: "vqhjwa", "xphfj", and "vjxgzr". If the ytw on the previous trial is equal to the mkepe on the current trial and the mkepe on the previous trial is not equal to the nbv on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "vqhjwa". If the ytw on the previous trial is not equal to the mkepe on the current trial and the mkepe on the previous trial is equal to the nbv on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "xphfj". If the ytw on the previous trial is not equal to the mkepe on the current trial and the mkepe on the previous trial is not equal to the nbv on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "vjxgzr".
