The brbmt factor depends on the transition of the tglvmx factor and has three levels: "prtnf", "racrn", and "olao". If the tglvmx on the current trial is "pulu" and the tglvmx on the previous trial is not "tkon", then the trial is considered a "prtnf". If the tglvmx on the current trial is not "pulu" and the tglvmx on the previous trial is "tkon", then the trial is considered a "racrn". Otherwise, the trial is considered an "olao".
