The fpzy factor depends on the transition of the kcjg factor and has three levels: "ivdsvt", "ngq", and "enjasj". If the kcjg on the current trial is "wzx" and the kcjg on the previous trial is not "nft", then the trial is "ivdsvt". If the kcjg on the current trial is not "wzx" and the kcjg on the previous trial is "nft", then the trial is "ngq". Otherwise, the trial is "enjasj".
