The sealv factor depends on the transition of the nzl, xmiax, and vtzuv factors and has two levels: "hpwaa" and "sryzex". If the nzl on the current trial is not the same as the vtzuv on the previous trial or if the nzl on the previous trial is not the same as the xmiax on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "hpwaa". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "sryzex".
