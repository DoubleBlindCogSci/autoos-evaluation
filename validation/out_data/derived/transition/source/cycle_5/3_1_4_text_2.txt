The fpzy factor depends on the transition of the kcjg factor and has three levels: "ivdsvt", "ngq", and "enjasj". If the kcjg on the current trial is "wzx" and the kcjg on the previous trial is not "nft", then the trial is considered a "ivdsvt". If the kcjg on the current trial is not "wzx" and the kcjg on the previous trial is "nft", then the trial is considered a "ngq". Otherwise, the trial is considered an "enjasj".
