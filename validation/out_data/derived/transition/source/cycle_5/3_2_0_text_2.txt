The itt factor depends on the transition of the etbwc and xpzx factors and has three levels: "mhi", "zjkjh", and "mktwdr". If the etbwc on the previous trial is "otkqu" and the xpzx on the current trial is not "drfacm", then the trial is considered a "mhi". If the etbwc on the previous trial is not "otkqu" and the xpzx on the current trial is "drfacm", then the trial is considered a "zjkjh". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "mktwdr".
