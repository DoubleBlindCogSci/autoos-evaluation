The ylp factor depends on the transition of the kbyad, jrnzbu, and yepn factors and has three levels: "qwwz", "zqmb", and "yqqnsu". If the kbyad on the current trial matches the yepn on the previous trial and the kbyad on the previous trial does not match the jrnzbu on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "qwwz". If the yepn on the previous trial does not match the kbyad on the current trial and the kbyad on the previous trial matches the jrnzbu on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "zqmb". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "yqqnsu".
