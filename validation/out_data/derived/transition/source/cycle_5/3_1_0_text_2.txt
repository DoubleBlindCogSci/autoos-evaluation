The norzp factor depends on the transition of the hibrnw factor and has three levels: "ysu", "ovfnl", and "nfyhcz". If the hibrnw on the current trial is "blomac" and the hibrnw on the previous trial is not "hdhoy", then the trial is considered a "ysu". If the hibrnw on the current trial is "hdhoy" and the hibrnw on the previous trial is "blomac", then the trial is considered a "ovfnl". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "nfyhcz".
