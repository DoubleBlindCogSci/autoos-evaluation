The pklwju factor depends on the transition of the oimbuy and hppah factors and has three levels: "pspk", "gelwv", and "sswak". If the oimbuy on the previous trial is "sykg" and the hppah on the current trial is not "eump", then the trial is considered a "pspk". If the oimbuy on the previous trial is not "sykg" and the hppah on the current trial is "eump", then the trial is considered a "gelwv". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "sswak".
