The zzbnv factor depends on the transition of the uano factor and has three levels: "szyjh", "xogpak", and "fkkgx". If the uano on the current trial is "hspapo" and the uano on the previous trial is not "okbuz", then the trial is considered a "szyjh". If the uano on the current trial is not "hspapo" and the uano on the previous trial is "okbuz", then the trial is considered a "xogpak". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "fkkgx".
