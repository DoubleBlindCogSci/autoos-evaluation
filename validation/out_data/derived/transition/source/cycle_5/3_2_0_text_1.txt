The itt factor depends on the transition of the etbwc and xpzx factors and has three levels: "mhi", "zjkjh", and "mktwdr". If the etbwc on the previous trial is "otkqu" and the xpzx on the current trial is not "drfacm", then the trial is "mhi". If the etbwc on the previous trial is not "otkqu" and the xpzx on the current trial is "drfacm", then the trial is "zjkjh". Otherwise, the trial is "mktwdr".
