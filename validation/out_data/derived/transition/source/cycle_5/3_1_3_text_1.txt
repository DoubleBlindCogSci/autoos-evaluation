The brbmt factor depends on the transition of the tglvmx factor and has three levels: "prtnf", "racrn", and "olao". If the tglvmx on the current trial is "pulu" and the tglvmx on the previous trial is not "tkon", then the trial is "prtnf". If the tglvmx on the current trial is not "pulu" and the tglvmx on the previous trial is "tkon", then the trial is "racrn". Otherwise, the trial is "olao".
