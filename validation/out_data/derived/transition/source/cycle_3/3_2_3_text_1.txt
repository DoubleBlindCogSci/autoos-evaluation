The sfhdj factor depends on the transition of the imgt and ffi factors and has three levels: "kssc", "zaui", and "nqwa". If the imgt on the previous trial is "rcuu" and the ffi on the current trial is not "mbn", then the trial is "kssc". If the imgt on the previous trial is not "rcuu" and the ffi on the current trial is "mbn", then the trial is "zaui". Otherwise, the trial is "nqwa".
