The lfako factor depends on the transition of the ebrckx, qfzure, and jgvfzo factors and has three levels: "bahnt", "ezdu", and "atwd". If the jgvfzo on the previous trial is the same as the ebrckx on the current trial and the ebrckx on the previous trial is not the same as the qfzure on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "bahnt". If the jgvfzo on the previous trial is not the same as the ebrckx on the current trial and the ebrckx on the previous trial is the same as the qfzure on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "ezdu". Otherwise, the trial is considered an "atwd".
