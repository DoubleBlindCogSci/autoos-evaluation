The twha factor depends on the transition of the nwk factor and has three levels: "boqyr", "xfme", and "ppjfl". If the nwk on the previous trial is "hump" and the nwk on the current trial is not "pncppn", then the trial is considered a "boqyr". If the nwk on the previous trial is not "hump" and the nwk on the current trial is "pncppn", then the trial is considered a "xfme". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "ppjfl".
