The jgigg factor depends on the transition of the vgbnj factor and has three levels: "ocpjh", "lzq", and "vzyhs". If the vgbnj on the current trial is "xerqu" and the vgbnj on the previous trial is not "okv", then the trial is considered a "ocpjh". If the vgbnj on the current trial is not "xerqu" and the vgbnj on the previous trial is "okv", then the trial is considered a "lzq". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "vzyhs".
