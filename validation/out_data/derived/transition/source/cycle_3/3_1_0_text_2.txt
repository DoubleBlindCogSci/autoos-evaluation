The vacdzn factor depends on the transition of the bsszxa factor and has three levels: "aaiu", "plu", and "gusq". If the bsszxa on the current trial is "qwco" and the bsszxa on the previous trial is not "qbylzt", then the trial is considered an "aaiu". If the bsszxa on the current trial is not "qwco" and the bsszxa on the previous trial is "qbylzt", then the trial is considered a "plu". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "gusq".
