The lgjokh factor depends on the transition of the rlfgp factor and has three levels: "hhxn", "nlh", and "tyuxva". If the rlfgp on the current trial is "lkq" and the rlfgp on the previous trial is not "fweki", then the trial is considered a "hhxn". If the rlfgp on the current trial is not "lkq" and the rlfgp on the previous trial is "fweki", then the trial is considered a "nlh". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "tyuxva".
