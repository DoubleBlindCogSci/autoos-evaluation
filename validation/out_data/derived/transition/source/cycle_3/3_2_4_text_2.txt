The keh factor depends on the transition of the yxskru, xwdi, and ybzis factors and has three levels: "jtwgjn", "hjzs", and "gnrwj". If the yxskru on the current trial matches the ybzis on the previous trial and the yxskru on the previous trial does not match the xwdi on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "jtwgjn". If the ybzis on the previous trial does not match the yxskru on the current trial and the yxskru on the previous trial matches the xwdi on the current trial, then the trial is considered a "hjzs". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "gnrwj".
