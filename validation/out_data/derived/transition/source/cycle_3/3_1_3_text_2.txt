The jjo factor depends on the transition of the ninu factor and has three levels: "omq", "fgtggu", and "lkwyt". If the ninu on the previous trial is "nxmjre" and the ninu on the current trial is not "ujbh", then the trial is considered "omq". If the ninu on the previous trial is not "nxmjre" and the ninu on the current trial is "ujbh", then the trial is considered "fgtggu". Otherwise, the trial is considered "lkwyt".
