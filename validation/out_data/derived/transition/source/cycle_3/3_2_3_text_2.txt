The sfhdj factor depends on the transition of the imgt and ffi factors and has three levels: "kssc", "zaui", and "nqwa". If the imgt on the previous trial is "rcuu" and the ffi on the current trial is not "mbn", then the trial is considered a "kssc". If the imgt on the previous trial is not "rcuu" and the ffi on the current trial is "mbn", then the trial is considered a "zaui". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "nqwa".
