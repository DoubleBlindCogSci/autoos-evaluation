The roau factor depends on the transition of the nyy and eqgxv factors and has three levels: "gzuju", "wvbiev", and "iaqvaw". If the nyy on the previous trial is "fzzu" and the eqgxv on the current trial is not "xuyt", then the trial is considered a "gzuju". If the nyy on the previous trial is not "fzzu" and the eqgxv on the current trial is "xuyt", then the trial is considered a "wvbiev". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "iaqvaw".
