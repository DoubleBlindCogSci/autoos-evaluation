The aqw factor depends on the transition of the blfi and rqnon factors and has three levels: "uqln", "lydag", and "enmxhf". If the blfi on the previous trial is "poogo" and the rqnon on the current trial is not "cuwi", then the trial is considered a "uqln". If the blfi on the previous trial is not "poogo" and the rqnon on the current trial is "cuwi", then the trial is considered a "lydag". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "enmxhf".
