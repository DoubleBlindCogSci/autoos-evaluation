The hocpea factor depends on the transition of the fpmp and ncvlo factors and has two levels: "onqun" and "vgarrq". If the fpmp on the current trial is not "ozu" and the ncvlo on the previous trial is not "noxk", then the trial is considered a "onqun". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "vgarrq".
