We counterbalanced the qlrk and the sybqg factor individually. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that exactly 2 trials with the level "jtmlcs" in the qax factor occured. Also, we excluded all trials in which the hgduyx factor was "ewexc". Also, we allowed for no more than 2 trials in a row with the level "yqvovc" in the czn factor.
