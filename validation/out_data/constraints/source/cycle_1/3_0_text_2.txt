We counterbalanced the xnh and the qqvz factor individually. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that no more than 2 trials in a row with the level "jqdtud" in the jxtk factor occured. Also, there were always at least 3 trials in a row with the level "gutwm" in the baiy factor. Also, there were always exactly 3 trials in a row with the level "rvn" in the cpcz factor.
