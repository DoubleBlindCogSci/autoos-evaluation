We counterbalanced the flirem and the rgp factor individually. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that exactly 4 trials with the level "hlnrh" in the crxpce factor occured. Also, there were exactly 2 trials with the level "vpejld" in the bhxrvp factor. Also, there were at most 2 trials in a row with the level "ytrjy" in the wgnnv factor.
