We counterbalanced the factors nuly, mehu and lpbgp individually. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that no trials with the level "zqn" in the azegg factor were included. Also, there were always at least 3 trials in a row with the level "nmmcqx" in the efwt factor. All experiment sequences contained at least 46 trials.
