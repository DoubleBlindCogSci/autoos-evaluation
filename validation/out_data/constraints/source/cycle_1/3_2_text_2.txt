We crossed the tsgpzz and the syu factors. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that no more than 2 trials in a row with the level "hez" in the sjrkg factor occured. Also, there were always exactly 4 trials with the level "agaw" in the lekrjk factor. All experiment sequences contained at least 48 trials.
