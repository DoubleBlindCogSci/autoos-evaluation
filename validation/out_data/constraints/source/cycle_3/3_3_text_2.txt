We counterbalanced the qmocmz factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that no trials with the level "jfbj" in the kxpgtn factor were included. Also, there were always exactly three trials in a row with the level "lic" in the twqlft factor. Finally, there were no more than two trials in a row with the level "xvv" in the ixez factor.
