We crossed the xzh, mant and ugyl factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that exactly 2 trials with the level "jkb" in the ogbl factor occured. Also, we excluded all trials in which the teyclb factor was "kuu". Also, exactly 3 trials with the level "hmbn" in the bxxl factor occured.
