We counterbalanced the jpgvuy factor individually. We crossed the gwghub and the uzdm factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that no trials with the level "lhf" in the jpgvuy factor were included. Also, there were always exactly three trials in a row with the level "axlm" in the gwghub factor. Finally, there were never more than two trials in a row with the level "ruptw" in the uzdm factor.
