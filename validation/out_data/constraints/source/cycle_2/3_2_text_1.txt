We crossed the wnh, rxvqmd and mzsfvk factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that exactly 3 trials with the level "mzr" in the gzepk factor occured. Also, there were always at least 2 trials in a row with the level "yelac" in the xlfcmx factor. All experiment sequences contained at least 48 trials.
