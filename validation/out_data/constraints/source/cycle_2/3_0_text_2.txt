We crossed the qdyr, rnaqv and lit factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that exactly 2 trials with the level "tvibc" in the ipj factor were included. Also, we excluded all trials in which the dqgb factor was "awada". All experiment sequences contained at least 47 trials.
