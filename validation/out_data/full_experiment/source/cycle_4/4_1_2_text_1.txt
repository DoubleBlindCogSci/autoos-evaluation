There are four regular factors: hpocc, yljkz, eppi, and rkfb. The hpocc factor consists of two levels: "xqvh" and "ppja". The yljkz factor consists of two levels: "aua" and "yrdzt". The eppi factor consists of two levels: "xqvh" and "ppja". The rkfb factor consists of two levels: "aua" and "yrdzt".
The bft factor depends on the yljkz and eppi factors and has two levels: "sxhbt" and "bzmddf". If the yljkz factor matches the eppi factor, then the trial is considered "sxhbt". Otherwise, the trial is considered "bzmddf".
We crossed the yljkz factor with the bft factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to two constraints. First, we allowed for at least 4 of the same yljkz in a row. Second, we allowed for exactly 2 of the same yljkz in a row.
