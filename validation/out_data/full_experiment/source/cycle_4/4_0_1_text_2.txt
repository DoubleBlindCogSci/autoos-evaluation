There are four regular factors: dpgpee, sbbw, cbglx, and kxru. The dpgpee factor consists of two levels: "griwc" and "rcttpe". The sbbw factor consists of two levels: "voq" and "iatd". The cbglx factor consists of two levels: "griwc" and "rcttpe". The kxru factor consists of two levels: "voq" and "iatd". The dpgpee and cbglx factors are crossed. The minimum number of trials is 31.
We crossed the cbglx and the dpgpee factor. All experiment sequences contained at least 31 trials.
