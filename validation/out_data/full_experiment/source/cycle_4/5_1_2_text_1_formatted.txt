### REGULAR FACTORS
There are five regular factors: yvt, nwy, shy, yvnfyr, and eqhnnb. The yvt factor consists of two levels: "aspg" and "mypy". The nwy factor consists of two levels: "ludty" and "sniosf". The shy factor consists of two levels: "aspg" and "mypy". The yvnfyr factor consists of two levels: "ludty" and "sniosf". The eqhnnb factor consists of two levels: "xjf" and "oxjjzy".
### DERIVED FACTORS
There is a derived factor called cdf.
## cdf
The cdf factor depends on the eqhnnb and yvt factors and has two levels: "rprpk" and "zydsnt". A trial is considered "rprpk" if the eqhnnb factor matches the yvt factor, otherwise, it is considered "zydsnt".
### EXPERIMENT
We crossed the yvt and the yvnfyr factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that no more than 4 of the same yvt transitions could occur in a row. All experiment sequences contained at least 32 trials.
