The cdf factor is derived from the eqhThe cdf factor depends on the eqhnnb and yvt factors and has two levels: "rprpk" and "zydsnt". A trial is considered "rprpk" if the eqhnnb factor matches the yvt factor, otherwise, it is considered "zydsnt".
We crossed the yvt and the yvnfyr factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that no more than 4 of the same yvt could occur in a row. All experiment sequences contained at least 32 trials.
