There are eight regular factors: zzikcb, vwx, wowvt, vwq, fchnpa, eiznef, smr, and ulkwbd. The zzikcb factor consists of two levels: "vqfk" and "agw". The vwx factor consists of two levels: "mgm" and "ujhniq". The wowvt factor consists of two levels: "vqfk" and "agw". The vwq factor consists of two levels: "mgm" and "ujhniq". The fchnpa factor consists of two levels: "cbk" and "gvdxnm". The eiznef factor consists of two levels: "trjw" and "oerf". The smr factor consists of two levels: "izh" and "clwvo". The ulkwbd factor consists of two levels: "cvnh" and "ysbpo".
The smr factor depends on the wowvt and zzikcb factors and has two levels: "izh" and "clwvo". If the wowvt factor matches the zzikcb factor, then the trial is considered "izh". Otherwise, the trial is considered "clwvo".
The ulkwbd factor depends on the vwx and eiznef factors and has two levels: "cvnh" and "ysbpo". If the vwx factor matches the eiznef factor, then the trial is considered a "cvnh". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "ysbpo".
We crossed the vwx and the zzikcb factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that at least 2 trials in a row with the level "mgm" in the vwx factor occured. Also, there were at most 2 trials in a row with the level "trjw" in the eiznef factor.
