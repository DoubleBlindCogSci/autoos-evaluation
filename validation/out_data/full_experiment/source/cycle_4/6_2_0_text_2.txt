There are eight regular factors: ewdwvi, jnz, pdu, zieg, pqogoq, jck, sni, and fodyo. The ewdwvi factor consists of two levels: "bvzbbc" and "hlv". The jnz factor consists of two levels: "nmdg" and "mook". The pdu factor consists of two levels: "bvzbbc" and "hlv". The zieg factor consists of two levels: "nmdg" and "mook". The pqogoq factor consists of two levels: "jhn" and "kym". The jck factor consists of two levels: "dghcps" and "sfxk". The sni factor consists of two levels: "lqrzx" and "kcz". The fodyo factor consists of two levels: "glom" and "tnxby".
The sni factor depends on the zieg and jnz factors and has two levels: "lqrzx" and "kcz". If the zieg factor matches the jnz factor, then the trial is considered "lqrzx". Otherwise, the trial is considered "kcz".
The fodyo factor depends on the pdu and ewdwvi factors and has two levels: "glom" and "tnxby". If the pdu factor matches the ewdwvi factor, then the trial is considered a "glom". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "tnxby".
We crossed the jck and the fodyo factor.
