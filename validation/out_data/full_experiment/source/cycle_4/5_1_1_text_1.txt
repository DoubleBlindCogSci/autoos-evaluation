There are five regular factors: avum, lzq, cxoc, ukhrk, and guphvz. The avum factor consists of two levels: "oybsg" and "gtx". The lzq factor consists of two levels: "xrx" and "vawzds". The cxoc factor consists of two levels: "oybsg" and "gtx". The ukhrk factor consists of two levels: "xrx" and "vawzds". The guphvz factor consists of two levels: "mmmq" and "tcwyd".
The ussdf factor depends on the guphvz and lzq factors and has two levels: "kcln" and "waekbz". If the guphvz matches the lzq, then the trial is "kcln". Otherwise, the trial is "waekbz".
We crossed the avum and the guphvz factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that no more than 3 of the same ukhrk transitions could occur in a row.
