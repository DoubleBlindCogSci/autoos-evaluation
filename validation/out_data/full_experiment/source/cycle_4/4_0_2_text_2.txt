There are four regular factors: vbuipz, ilcgi, ggw, and dolfc. The vbuipz factor consists of two levels: "wkzx" and "iuoqy". The ilcgi factor consists of two levels: "vkdwcr" and "klerfi". The ggw factor consists of two levels: "wkzx" and "iuoqy". The dolfc factor consists of two levels: "vkdwcr" and "klerfi". There are two constraints: At most two levels of the ggw factor can occur in a row, and there must be at least 46 trials. The ggw factor and the vbuipz factor are crossed.
We crossed the ggw and the vbuipz factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that no more than 2 of the same ggw transitions could occur in a row. All experiment sequences contained at least 46 trials.
