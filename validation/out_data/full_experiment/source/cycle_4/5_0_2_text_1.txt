There are five regular factors: muv, xqnr, rggn, xhstdg, and vezedn. The muv factor consists of two levels: "hdbuig" and "xtfto". The xqnr factor consists of two levels: "razmc" and "byv". The rggn factor consists of two levels: "hdbuig" and "xtfto". The xhstdg factor consists of two levels: "razmc" and "byv". The vezedn factor consists of two levels: "osby" and "tkvl".
We crossed the rggn and the vezedn factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that at least 2 trials with the level "hdbuig" in the muv factor occured. Also, there were always exactly 4 trials in a row with the level "hdbuig" in the rggn factor.
