### REGULAR FACTORS
There are five regular factors: avum, lzq, cxoc, ukhrk, and guphvz. The avum factor consists of two levels: "oybsg" and "gtx". The lzq factor consists of two levels: "xrx" and "vawzds". The cxoc factor consists of two levels: "oybsg" and "gtx". The ukhrk factor consists of two levels: "xrx" and "vawzds". The guphvz factor consists of two levels: "mmmq" and "tcwyd".
### DERIVED FACTORS
There is a derived factor called ussdf.
## ussdf
The ussdf factor depends on the guphvz and lzq factors and has two levels: "kcln" and "waekbz". If the guphvz matches the lzq, then the trial is "kcln". Otherwise, the trial is "waekbz".
### EXPERIMENT
We crossed the avum and the guphvz factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that no more than 3 of the same ukhrk transitions could occur in a row.
