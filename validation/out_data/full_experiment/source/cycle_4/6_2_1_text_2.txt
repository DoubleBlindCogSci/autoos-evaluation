There are eight regular factors: mws, foz, fnki, mqjb, joon, gfttb, bgysdr, and nxivbj. The mws factor consists of two levels: "rwtfmd" and "nqym". The foz factor consists of two levels: "frp" and "mcwtms". The fnki factor consists of two levels: "rwtfmd" and "nqym". The mqjb factor consists of two levels: "frp" and "mcwtms". The joon factor consists of two levels: "cmuq" and "pmuo". The gfttb factor consists of two levels: "vhsq" and "zuzdel". The bgysdr factor consists of two levels: "mzqo" and "cgvco". The nxivbj factor consists of two levels: "dgkhjr" and "kyst".
The bgysdr factor depends on the gfttb and mqjb factors and has two levels: "mzqo" and "cgvco". A trial is considered "mzqo" if the gfttb factor matches the mqjb factor, otherwise, it is considered "cgvco".
The nxivbj factor depends on the mws and fnki factors and has two levels: "dgkhjr" and "kyst". A trial is considered "dgkhjr" if the mws matches the fnki, otherwise, it is considered "kyst".
We crossed the joon and the nxivbj factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that exactly 3 trials with the level "mzqo" in the bgysdr factor occured in a row.
