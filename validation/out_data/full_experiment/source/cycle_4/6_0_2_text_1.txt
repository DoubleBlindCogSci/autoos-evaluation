There are six regular factors: wisd, ufvgm, uhi, qkblr, yztd, and uybw. The wisd factor consists of two levels: "vzxi" and "oqw". The ufvgm factor consists of two levels: "wlnkit" and "ykhfb". The uhi factor consists of two levels: "vzxi" and "oqw". The qkblr factor consists of two levels: "wlnkit" and "ykhfb". The yztd factor consists of two levels: "rofop" and "hmrh". The uybw factor consists of two levels: "anliv" and "rgvgo".
We crossed the uhi and the yztd factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that exactly 2 trials with the level "anliv" in the uybw factor occured. Also, there were always at least 4 trials in a row with the level "wlnkit" in the ufvgm factor.
