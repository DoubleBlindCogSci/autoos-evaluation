There are six regular factors: wisd, ufvgm, uhi, qkblr, yztd, and uybw. The wisd factor consists of two levels: "vzxi" and "oqw". The ufvgm factor consists of two levels: "wlnkit" and "ykhfb". The uhi factor consists of two levels: "vzxi" and "oqw". The qkblr factor consists of two levels: "wlnkit" and "ykhfb". The yztd factor consists of two levels: "rofop" and "hmrh". The uybw factor consists of two levels: "anliv" and "rgvgo". There are two constraints: The first constraint is that the level "anliv" of the uybw factor must occur exactly two times. The second constraint is that the level "wlnkit" of the ufvgm factor must occur at least four times in a row. The crossing factors are uhi and yztd.
We crossed the uhi and the yztd factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that exactly 2 trials with the level "anliv" in the uybw factor occured. Also, there were always at least 4 trials in a row with the level "wlnkit" in the ufvgm factor.
