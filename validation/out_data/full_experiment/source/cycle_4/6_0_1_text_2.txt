There are six regular factors: qgplsu, jjssm, xaqd, utkb, nsmo, and qpgyns. The qgplsu factor consists of two levels: "pboibu" and "zqdel". The jjssm factor consists of two levels: "riesgx" and "mxl". The xaqd factor consists of two levels: "pboibu" and "zqdel". The utkb factor consists of two levels: "riesgx" and "mxl". The nsmo factor consists of two levels: "zaxwi" and "zews". The qpgyns factor consists of two levels: "dha" and "upj". The qpgyns factor is crossed with the nsmo factor. The qpgyns factor is also constrained to have at least four levels in a row.
We crossed the qpgyns and the nsmo factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that at least 4 trials with the level "dha" in the qpgyns factor occured.
