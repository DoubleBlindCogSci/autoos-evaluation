There are six regular factors: uwlh, uza, bog, boh, znx, and dupc. The uwlh factor consists of two levels: "hhs" and "ptiktj". The uza factor consists of two levels: "uiq" and "tmxav". The bog factor consists of two levels: "hhs" and "ptiktj". The boh factor consists of two levels: "uiq" and "tmxav". The znx factor consists of two levels: "yjafe" and "kndf". The dupc factor consists of two levels: "duyj" and "ffiokh". The crossing factors are bog and uza. The constraints are: At least three "yjafe" levels in a row and exactly three "ffiokh" levels in a row.
The znx factor depends on the uwlh and boh factors and has two levels: "yjafe" and "kndf". A trial is considered "yjafe" if the uwlh matches the boh, otherwise, it is considered "kndf".
The dupc factor depends on the uza and bog factors and has two levels: "duyj" and "ffiokh". A trial is considered "duyj" if the uza matches the bog, otherwise, it is considered "ffiokh".
We crossed the bog and the uza factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that at least 3 "yjafe" trials were in a row. Also there were always exactly 3 "ffiokh" trials in a row.
