There are four regular factors: uwlh, uza, bog, and boh. The uwlh factor consists of two levels: "hhs" and "ptiktj". The uza factor consists of two levels: "uiq" and "tmxav". The bog factor consists of two levels: "hhs" and "ptiktj". The boh factor consists of two levels: "uiq" and "tmxav".
The znx factor depends on the uwlh and boh factors and has two levels: "yjafe" and "kndf". A trial is considered "yjafe" if the uwlh matches the boh, otherwise, it is considered "kndf".
The dupc factor depends on the uza and bog factors and has two levels: "duyj" and "ffiokh". If the uza factor matches the bog factor, then the trial is considered "duyj". Otherwise, the trial is considered "ffiokh".
We crossed the bog and the uza factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that at least 3 trials in a row with the level "yjafe" in the znx factor occured. Also there were always exactly 3 trials in a row with the level "ffiokh" in the boh factor.
