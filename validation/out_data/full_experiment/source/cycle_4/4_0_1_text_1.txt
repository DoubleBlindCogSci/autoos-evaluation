There are four regular factors: dpgpee, sbbw, cbglx, and kxru. The dpgpee factor consists of two levels: "griwc" and "rcttpe". The sbbw factor also consists of two levels: "voq" and "iatd". The cbglx factor consists of two levels: "griwc" and "rcttpe". The kxru factor consists of two levels: "voq" and "iatd".
We crossed the cbglx and the dpgpee factor. All experiment sequences contained at least 31 trials.
