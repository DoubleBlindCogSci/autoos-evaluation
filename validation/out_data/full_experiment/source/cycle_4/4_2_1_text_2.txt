There are six regular factors: wzltf, xkx, adasp, kbdfej, hwsmo, and ejihet. The wzltf factor consists of two levels: "wkh" and "jfimzl". The xkx factor consists of two levels: "xdmxg" and "yrlgcb". The adasp factor consists of two levels: "wkh" and "jfimzl". The kbdfej factor consists of two levels: "xdmxg" and "yrlgcb". The hwsmo factor consists of two levels: "mpopni" and "wicxmx". The ejihet factor consists of two levels: "ylb" and "fedzj".
The hwsmo factor depends on the wzltf and kbdfej factors and has two levels: "mpopni" and "wicxmx". A trial is considered "mpopni" if the wzltf matches the kbdfej, otherwise, it is considered "wicxmx".
The ejihet factor depends on the adasp and xkx factors and has two levels: "ylb" and "fedzj". A trial is considered "ylb" if the adasp matches the xkx, otherwise, it is considered "fedzj".
We crossed the ejihet and the kbdfej factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that no more than 2 of the same adasp transitions could occur in a row.
