There are six regular factors: zzikcb, vwx, wowvt, vwq, fchnpa, and eiznef. The zzikcb factor consists of two levels: "vqfk" and "agw". The vwx factor consists of two levels: "mgm" and "ujhniq". The wowvt factor consists of two levels: "vqfk" and "agw". The vwq factor consists of two levels: "mgm" and "ujhniq". The fchnpa factor consists of two levels: "cbk" and "gvdxnm". The eiznef factor consists of two levels: "trjw" and "oerf".
The smr factor depends on the factors wowvt and zzikcb and has two levels: "izh" and "clwvo". If the wowvt factor matches the zzikcb factor, then the trial is considered "izh". Otherwise, the trial is considered "clwvo".
The ulkwbd factor depends on the vwx and eiznef factors and has two levels: "cvnh" and "ysbpo". If the vwx matches the eiznef, then the trial is "cvnh". Otherwise, the trial is "ysbpo".
We crossed the vwx and the zzikcb factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that at least 2 of the same vwx occured in a row. Also, there were at most 2 of the same eiznef in a row.
