### REGULAR FACTORS
There are six regular factors: edkiip, mas, erdzl, odbrwn, egh, and ukmfq. The edkiip factor consists of two levels: "ddtexz" and "fecbd". The mas factor consists of two levels: "zdqq" and "chnyyz". The erdzl factor consists of two levels: "ddtexz" and "fecbd". The odbrwn factor consists of two levels: "zdqq" and "chnyyz". The egh factor consists of two levels: "oxg" and "pbouw". The ukmfq factor consists of two levels: "lumokl" and "rkahyg".
### DERIVED FACTORS
There is a derived factor called yhm.
## yhm
The yhm factor depends on the ukmfq and mas factors and has two levels: "jdmfqw" and "det". If the ukmfq matches the mas, then the trial is "jdmfqw". Otherwise, the trial is "det".
### EXPERIMENT
We crossed the odbrwn and the erdzl factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that exactly 3 trials with the level "jdmfqw" in the odbrwn factor occured in a row.
