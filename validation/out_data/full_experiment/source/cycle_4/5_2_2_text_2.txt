There are seven regular factors: ihaxo, mwabx, drfsq, wwviw, ddx, mehm, and trtz. The ihaxo factor consists of two levels: "nebj" and "gqov". The mwabx factor consists of two levels: "upfna" and "qnn". The drfsq factor consists of two levels: "nebj" and "gqov". The wwviw factor consists of two levels: "upfna" and "qnn". The ddx factor consists of two levels: "oesdd" and "cgcxdg". The mehm factor consists of two levels: "onat" and "zbtzh". The trtz factor consists of two levels: "itvon" and "cuvewk".
The mehm factor depends on the wwviw and ddx factors and has two levels: "onat" and "zbtzh". If the wwviw factor matches the ddx factor, then the trial is considered "onat". Otherwise, the trial is considered "zbtzh".
The trtz factor depends on the drfsq and ihaxo factors and has two levels: "itvon" and "cuvewk". A trial is considered "itvon" if the drfsq factor matches the ihaxo factor, otherwise, it is considered "cuvewk".
We crossed the wwviw and the trtz factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that exactly 3 trials with the level "cuvewk" in the trtz factor were included. Also, there were always at least 2 trials in a row with the level "cuvewk" in the trtz factor.
