### REGULAR FACTORS
There are five regular factors: opth, jtwon, qgaatu, cnekt, and ryuvgo. The opth factor consists of two levels: "cupxsi" and "jehney". The jtwon factor consists of two levels: "nupd" and "tkkn". The qgaatu factor consists of two levels: "cupxsi" and "jehney". The cnekt factor consists of two levels: "nupd" and "tkkn". The ryuvgo factor consists of two levels: "hsm" and "ghlii".
### EXPERIMENT
We crossed the cnekt and the jtwon factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that exactly 4 trials with the level "nupd" in the cnekt factor occured in a row.
