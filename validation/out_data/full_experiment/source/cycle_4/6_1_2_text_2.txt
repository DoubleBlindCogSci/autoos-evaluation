There are seven regular factors: snat, kaqka, lvisj, gqw, wkqe, pyoyje, and hjip. The snat factor consists of two levels: "pkijs" and "krrj". The kaqka factor consists of two levels: "inqo" and "qggwd". The lvisj factor consists of two levels: "pkijs" and "krrj". The gqw factor consists of two levels: "inqo" and "qggwd". The wkqe factor consists of two levels: "cpar" and "pcfsm". The pyoyje factor consists of two levels: "yejf" and "aupzma". The hjip factor consists of two levels: "tutcm" and "micqz". The hjip factor is a derived factor. The hjip factor is derived from the lvisj and pyoyje factors. The "tutcm" level of the hjip factor is derived from the lvisj and pyoyje factors. The "micqz" level of the hjip factor is derived from the lvisj and pyoyje factors. The hjip factor is crossed with the kaqka factor. There are two constraints: At most two "pkijs" levels of the snat factor can occur in a row. At least four "cpar" levels of the wkqe factor must occur in a row.
The hjip factor depends on the lvisj and pyoyje factors and has two levels: "tutcm" and "micqz". If the lvisj factor matches the pyoyje factor, then the trial is considered a "tutcm". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "micqz".
We crossed the kaqka factor with the hjip factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to two constraints. First, we allowed for no more than 2 of the same snat transitions in a row. Second, we allowed for at least 4 of the same wkqe transitions in a row.
