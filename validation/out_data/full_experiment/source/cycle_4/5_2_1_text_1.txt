There are five regular factors: kpdmg, olgh, ipxtj, pdjwng, and yuou. The kpdmg factor consists of two levels: "psclbm" and "lij". The olgh factor consists of two levels: "qru" and "lseg". The ipxtj factor consists of two levels: "psclbm" and "lij". The pdjwng factor consists of two levels: "qru" and "lseg". The yuou factor consists of two levels: "otpq" and "zgqit".
The uibycy factor depends on the olgh and kpdmg factors and has two levels: "mdp" and "kjvo". A trial is considered "mdp" if the olgh matches the kpdmg, otherwise, it is considered "kjvo".
The mpxrez factor depends on the pdjwng and yuou factors and has two levels: "ncv" and "xygm". A trial is considered "ncv" if the pdjwng matches the yuou, otherwise, it is considered "xygm".
We crossed the olgh and the uibycy factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that at least 4 trials with the level "ncv" in the mpxrez factor occured in a row.
