There are seven regular factors: edkiip, mas, erdzl, odbrwn, egh, ukmfq, and yhm. The edkiip factor consists of two levels: "ddtexz" and "fecbd". The mas factor consists of two levels: "zdqq" and "chnyyz". The erdzl factor consists of two levels: "ddtexz" and "fecbd". The odbrwn factor consists of two levels: "zdqq" and "chnyyz". The egh factor consists of two levels: "oxg" and "pbouw". The ukmfq factor consists of two levels: "lumokl" and "rkahyg". The yhm factor consists of two levels: "jdmfqw" and "det". The yhm factor is a derived factor. The level "jdmfqw" is derived from the levels of the ukmfq and mas factors. The level "det" is derived from the levels of the ukmfq and mas factors.

The odbrwn factor is crossed with the erdzl factor. The odbrwn factor is crossedThe yhm factor depends on the ukmfq and mas factors and has two levels: "jdmfqw" and "det". A trial is considered "jdmfqw" if the ukmfq matches the mas, otherwise, it is considered "det".
We crossed the odbrwn and the erdzl factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that exactly 3 trials with the level "jdmfqw" in the odbrwn factor occured in a row.
