There are six regular factors: kqs, xmy, mvcr, bzowuv, abkw, and zeqtq. The kqs factor consists of two levels: "tqou" and "zqh". The xmy factor consists of two levels: "nepkz" and "ntiaq". The mvcr factor consists of two levels: "tqou" and "zqh". The bzowuv factor consists of two levels: "nepkz" and "ntiaq". The abkw factor consists of two levels: "uil" and "kes". The zeqtq factor consists of two levels: "nhzv" and "npofit". The design is a crossed block design with the factors mvcr and xmy as crossing factors. The design has the following constraints: At least three "nhzv" levels in a row and at most two "nhzv" levels in a row.
We crossed the mvcr and the xmy factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that at least 3 trials with the level "nhzv" in the zeqtq factor occured. Also, there were at most 2 trials in a row with the level "nhzv" in the zeqtq factor.
