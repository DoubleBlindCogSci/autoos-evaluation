There are five regular factors: vkjko, wgrgtc, wewe, jkhd, and oir. The vkjko factor consists of two levels: "fga" and "pdoq". The wgrgtc factor consists of two levels: "bbwayz" and "tmthev". The wewe factor consists of two levels: "fga" and "pdoq". The jkhd factor consists of two levels: "bbwayz" and "tmthev". The oir factor consists of two levels: "bjpq" and "sfjahf".
The eivlb factor depends on the oir and jkhd factors and has two levels: "irho" and "hjbpis". If the oir factor matches the jkhd factor, then the trial is considered "irho". Otherwise, the trial is considered "hjbpis".
We crossed the wgrgtc and the eivlb factor. All experiment sequences contained at least 26 trials.
