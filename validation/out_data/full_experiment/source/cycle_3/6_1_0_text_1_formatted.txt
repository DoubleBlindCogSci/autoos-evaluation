### REGULAR FACTORS
There are six regular factors: hhf, glbouc, apb, deff, sfg, and hpyuyl. The hhf factor consists of two levels: "aumgo" and "mav". The glbouc factor also consists of two levels: "utchpn" and "cenp". The apb factor consists of two levels: "aumgo" and "mav". The deff factor also consists of two levels: "utchpn" and "cenp". The sfg factor consists of two levels: "cjxkp" and "pwwc". The hpyuyl factor also consists of two levels: "twhkmc" and "meeugm".
### DERIVED FACTORS
There is a derived factor called iqne.
## iqne
The iqne factor depends on the apb and deff factors and has two levels: "kicuw" and "yhcqux". If the apb factor matches the deff factor, then the trial is considered "kicuw". Otherwise, the trial is considered "yhcqux".
### EXPERIMENT
We crossed the iqne and the sfg factor.
