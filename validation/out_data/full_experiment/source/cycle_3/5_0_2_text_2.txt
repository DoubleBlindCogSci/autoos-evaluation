There are five regular factors: oyi, gxqk, holhg, wpl, and ngp. The oyi factor consists of two levels: "cjtg" and "hpmo". The gxqk factor consists of two levels: "rfk" and "usnhq". The holhg factor consists of two levels: "cjtg" and "hpmo". The wpl factor consists of two levels: "rfk" and "usnhq". The ngp factor consists of two levels: "qqk" and "eqpc". There are two constraints: AtMostKInARow(4, ngp) and MinimumTrials(16). The factors gxqk and holhg are crossed.
We crossed the gxqk and the holhg factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that no more than 4 of the same ngp transitions could occur in a row. All experiment sequences contained at least 16 trials.
