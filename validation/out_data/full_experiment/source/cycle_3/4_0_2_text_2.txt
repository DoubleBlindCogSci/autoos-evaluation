There are four regular factors: xllver, isvnwz, ayptso, and ayupup. The xllver factor consists of two levels: "kdzk" and "yea". The isvnwz factor consists of two levels: "egcg" and "vmymn". The ayptso factor consists of two levels: "kdzk" and "yea". The ayupup factor consists of two levels: "egcg" and "vmymn". The design consists of the four factors: xllver, isvnwz, ayptso, and ayupup. The crossing consists of the two factors: ayptso and ayupup. The constraints are: At least four trials in a row with the level "egcg" of the factor ayptso and at least 60 trials.
We crossed the ayptso and the ayupup factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that at least 4 trials with the level "egcg" in the ayptso factor occured. All experiment sequences contained at least 60 trials.
