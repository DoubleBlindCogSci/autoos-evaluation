There are five regular factors: mhwfb, xdpvuw, jtlrt, ior, and nhulxc. The mhwfb factor consists of two levels: "nqfkbi" and "hvatw". The xdpvuw factor consists of two levels: "xmkm" and "mbz". The jtlrt factor consists of two levels: "nqfkbi" and "hvatw". The ior factor consists of two levels: "xmkm" and "mbz". The nhulxc factor consists of two levels: "ffqhy" and "ydycxv".
The mps factor depends on the xdpvuw and jtlrt factors and has two levels: "yunbbk" and "gpiev". If the xdpvuw factor matches the jtlrt factor, then the trial is considered "yunbbk". Otherwise, the trial is considered "gpiev".
We crossed the xdpvuw and the mps factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that no more than 4 of the same mhwfb could occur in a row. All experiment sequences contained at least 26 trials.
