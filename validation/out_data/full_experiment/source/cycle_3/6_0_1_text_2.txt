There are six regular factors: dgizf, imjtfj, amui, paanhe, uirzmz, and qhpc. The dgizf factor consists of two levels: "omekh" and "jkt". The imjtfj factor consists of two levels: "gkhdp" and "fyjb". The amui factor consists of two levels: "omekh" and "jkt". The paanhe factor consists of two levels: "gkhdp" and "fyjb". The uirzmz factor consists of two levels: "tdo" and "gwtex". The qhpc factor consists of two levels: "esaypj" and "bps". The dgizf and qhpc factors are crossed. The uirzmz factor has the constraint that the level "esaypj" must appear at least four times in a row.
We crossed the dgizf and the qhpc factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that at least 4 "esaypj" trials were in a row.
