There are six regular factors: dnuay, khuiq, yqs, mtarj, mhibz, and cbgvt. The dnuay factor consists of two levels: "mrja" and "aoeg". The khuiq factor consists of two levels: "mvda" and "jfwow". The yqs factor consists of two levels: "mrja" and "aoeg". The mtarj factor consists of two levels: "mvda" and "jfwow". The mhibz factor consists of two levels: "eroq" and "irtmb". The cbgvt factor consists of two levels: "nxfjfi" and "dge".
The cbgvt factor depends on the mhibz and khuiq factors and has two levels: "nxfjfi" and "dge". A trial is considered "nxfjfi" if the mhibz matches the khuiq, otherwise, it is considered "dge".
We crossed the dnuay and the yqs factor.
