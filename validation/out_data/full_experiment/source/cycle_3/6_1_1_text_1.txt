There are six regular factors: opstb, hehx, bob, pdwuqf, pyxfb, and iwhnba. The opstb factor consists of two levels: "gizmm" and "oaxg". The hehx factor consists of two levels: "ewbu" and "vai". The bob factor consists of two levels: "gizmm" and "oaxg". The pdwuqf factor consists of two levels: "ewbu" and "vai". The pyxfb factor consists of two levels: "cohge" and "tdm". The iwhnba factor consists of two levels: "vehu" and "xmcl".
The niyyi factor depends on the bob and pdwuqf factors and has two levels: "ieeoy" and "wywxab". A trial is considered "ieeoy" if the bob factor matches the pdwuqf factor, otherwise, it is considered "wywxab".
We crossed the hehx and the pyxfb factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that at least 4 trials with the level "gizmm" in the opstb factor occured in a row.
