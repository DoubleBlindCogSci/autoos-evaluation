There are seven regular factors: kgx, ujbe, cbiwgn, tqlnk, pdhel, sfe, and latl. The kgx factor consists of two levels: "rxrgv" and "xdqhc". The ujbe factor consists of two levels: "jaehg" and "gmnopl". The cbiwgn factor consists of two levels: "rxrgv" and "xdqhc". The tqlnk factor consists of two levels: "jaehg" and "gmnopl".

The latl factor is derived from the pThe latl factor depends on the pdhel and ujbe factors and has two levels: "dgcdsk" and "zxrpht". A trial is considered "dgcdsk" if the pdhel factor matches the ujbe factor, otherwise, it is considered "zxrpht".
We crossed the cbiwgn and the latl factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to two constraints. First, we allowed for no more than 2 of the same sfe in a row. Second, we allowed for at least 2 of the same ujbe in a row.
