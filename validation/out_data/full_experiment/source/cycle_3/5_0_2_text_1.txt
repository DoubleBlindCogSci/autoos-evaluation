There are five regular factors: oyi, gxqk, holhg, wpl, and ngp. The oyi factor consists of two levels: "cjtg" and "hpmo". The gxqk factor also consists of two levels: "rfk" and "usnhq". The holhg factor consists of two levels: "cjtg" and "hpmo". The wpl factor consists of two levels: "rfk" and "usnhq". The ngp factor consists of two levels: "qqk" and "eqpc".
We crossed the gxqk and the holhg factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that no more than 4 of the same ngp transitions could occur in a row. All experiment sequences contained at least 16 trials.
