There are eight regular factors: avbwpg, xzx, qrtckt, zomk, dergv, ubzdcu, ftmaw, and upva. The avbwpg factor consists of two levels: "cimg" and "hbfe". The xzx factor consists of two levels: "fsk" and "nnbtc". The qrtckt factor consists of two levels: "cimg" and "hbfe". The zomk factor consists of two levels: "fsk" and "nnbtc". The dergv factor consists of two levels: "sxzdej" and "rxwuo". The ubzdcu factor consists of two levels: "vdom" and "mqg". The ftmaw factor consists of two levels: "nch" and "mfdpop". The upva factor consists of two levels: "gukug" and "bseu".
The ftmaw factor depends on the xzx and ubzdcu factors and has two levels: "nch" and "mfdpop". If the xzx factor matches the ubzdcu factor, then the trial is considered a "nch". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "mfdpop".
The upva factor depends on the qrtckt and dergv factors and has two levels: "gukug" and "bseu". A trial is considered "gukug" if the qrtckt factor matches the dergv factor, otherwise, it is considered "bseu".
We crossed the dergv and the zomk factor. All experiment sequences contained at least 29 trials.
