There are seven regular factors: hhf, glbouc, apb, deff, sfg, hpyuyl, and iqne. The hhf factor consists of two levels: "aumgo" and "mav". The glbouc factor consists of two levels: "utchpn" and "cenp". The apb factor consists of two levels: "aumgo" and "mav". The deff factor consists of two levels: "utchpn" and "cenp". The sfg factor consists of two levels: "cjxkp" and "pwwc". The hpyuyl factor consists of two levels: "twhkmc" and "meeugm". The iqne factor consists of two levels: "kicuw" and "yhcqux".
The iqne factor depends on the apb and deff factors and has two levels: "kicuw" and "yhcqux". If the apb factor matches the deff factor, then the trial is considered "kicuw". Otherwise, the trial is considered "yhcqux".
We crossed the iqne and the sfg factor.
