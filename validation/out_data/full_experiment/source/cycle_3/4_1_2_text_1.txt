There are four regular factors: ftg, cdt, wgrk, and buvqha. The ftg factor consists of two levels: "nqxlo" and "iqtp". The cdt factor also consists of two levels: "pcm" and "hqiju". The wgrk factor consists of two levels: "nqxlo" and "iqtp". The buvqha factor also consists of two levels: "pcm" and "hqiju".
The gcu factor depends on the cdt and wgrk factors and has two levels: "wziqu" and "slbd". A trial is considered "wziqu" if the cdt matches the wgrk, otherwise, it is considered "slbd".
We crossed the ftg and the gcu factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that exactly 3 trials with the level "wziqu" in the gcu factor occured. All experiment sequences contained at least 35 trials.
