### REGULAR FACTORS
There are four regular factors: bvtai, lembv, tfo, and jerk. The bvtai factor consists of two levels: "pvuel" and "slfm". The lembv factor also consists of two levels: "wfibz" and "tryd". The tfo factor consists of two levels: "pvuel" and "slfm". The jerk factor also consists of two levels: "wfibz" and "tryd".
### EXPERIMENT
We crossed the tfo and the bvtai factor. All experiment sequences contained at least 58 trials.
