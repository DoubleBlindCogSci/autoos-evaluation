There are four regular factors: dcoelt, wohi, zhzxp, and bsp. The dcoelt factor consists of two levels: "trehz" and "wrla". The wohi factor also consists of two levels: "kjz" and "tnks". The zhzxp factor consists of two levels: "trehz" and "wrla". The bsp factor also consists of two levels: "kjz" and "tnks".
The ryvm factor depends on the dcoelt and wohi factors and has two levels: "mdvu" and "sbgra". A trial is considered "mdvu" if the dcoelt matches the wohi, otherwise, it is considered "sbgra".
The uzbpmj factor depends on the zhzxp and bsp factors and has two levels: "ehyn" and "vslmq". If the zhzxp factor matches the bsp factor, then the trial is considered "ehyn". Otherwise, the trial is considered "vslmq".
We crossed the dcoelt and the zhzxp factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that all experiment sequences contained at least 45 trials.
