There are six regular factors: vipu, pfl, nshhcw, bwmn, yic, and sxt. The vipu factor consists of two levels: "nqaj" and "fftz". The pfl factor also consists of two levels: "vyo" and "xkgy". The nshhcw factor consists of two levels: "nqaj" and "fftz". The bwmn factor consists of two levels: "vyo" and "xkgy". The yic factor consists of two levels: "guxkbh" and "wekqv". The sxt factor consists of two levels: "pzruw" and "mcsdum".
The yic factor depends on the bwmn and nshhcw factors and has two levels: "guxkbh" and "wekqv". A trial is considered "guxkbh" if the bwmn factor matches the nshhcw factor, otherwise, it is considered "wekqv".
The sxt factor depends on the pfl and vipu factors and has two levels: "pzruw" and "mcsdum". A trial is considered "pzruw" if the pfl matches the vipu, otherwise, it is considered "mcsdum".
We crossed the pfl and the bwmn factor.
