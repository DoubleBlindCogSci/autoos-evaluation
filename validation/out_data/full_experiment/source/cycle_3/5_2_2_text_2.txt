There are seven regular factors: wxkp, fgiigi, vmp, fzb, kpdy, gdzodz, and bbo. The wxkp factor consists of two levels: "iqsqug" and "ygc". The fgiigi factor consists of two levels: "ukk" and "nojgu". The vmp factor consists of two levels: "iqsqug" and "ygc". The fzb factor consists of two levels: "ukk" and "nojgu". The kpdy factor consists of two levels: "hkoia" and "mploi". The gdzodz factor consists of two levels: "mwod" and "blf". The bbo factor consists of two levels: "dxh" and "hox".
The gdzodz factor depends on the vmp and fzb factors and has two levels: "mwod" and "blf". If the vmp factor matches the fzb factor, then the trial is considered a "mwod". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "blf".
The bbo factor depends on the fgiigi and wxkp factors and has two levels: "dxh" and "hox". A trial is considered "dxh" if the fgiigi factor matches the wxkp factor, otherwise, it is considered "hox".
We crossed the fzb and the gdzodz factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to two constraints. First, we allowed for no more than 2 of the same fgiigi levels in a row. Second, we allowed for at least 3 of the same gdzodz levels in a row.
