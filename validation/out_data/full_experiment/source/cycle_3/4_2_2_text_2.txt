There are six regular factors: toll, pkkm, hhizte, rhl, cwh, and hnt. The toll factor consists of two levels: "nqwgeu" and "wwudy". The pkkm factor consists of two levels: "khun" and "bkyhp". The hhizte factor consists of two levels: "nqwgeu" and "wwudy". The rhl factor consists of two levels: "khun" and "bkyhp". The cwh factor consists of two levels: "zdljt" and "blukz". The hnt factor consists of two levels: "rjvf" and "qoemb".
The cwh factor depends on the rhl and hhizte factors and has two levels: "zdljt" and "blukz". If the rhl factor matches the hhizte factor, then the trial is considered a "zdljt". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "blukz".
The hnt factor depends on the pkkm and toll factors and has two levels: "rjvf" and "qoemb". A trial is considered "rjvf" if the pkkm factor matches the toll factor, otherwise, it is considered "qoemb".
We crossed the toll factor with the hhizte factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that at least 4 trials with the same level in the hhizte factor occured in a row. All experiment sequences contained at least 36 trials.
