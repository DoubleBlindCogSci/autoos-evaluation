There are six regular factors: avbwpg, xzx, qrtckt, zomk, dergv, and ubzdcu. The avbwpg factor consists of two levels: "cimg" and "hbfe". The xzx factor consists of two levels: "fsk" and "nnbtc". The qrtckt factor consists of two levels: "cimg" and "hbfe". The zomk factor consists of two levels: "fsk" and "nnbtc". The dergv factor consists of two levels: "sxzdej" and "rxwuo". The ubzdcu factor consists of two levels: "vdom" and "mqg".
The ftmaw factor depends on the xzx and ubzdcu factors and has two levels: "nch" and "mfdpop". A trial is considered "nch" if the xzx matches the ubzdcu, otherwise, it is considered "mfdpop".
The upva factor depends on the qrtckt and dergv factors and has two levels: "gukug" and "bseu". A trial is considered "gukug" if the qrtckt matches the dergv, otherwise, it is considered "bseu".
We crossed the dergv and the zomk factor. All experiment sequences contained at least 29 trials.
