There are four regular factors: rzadpo, tcx, mpsi, and qqsuu. The rzadpo factor consists of two levels: "elxlc" and "zim". The tcx factor consists of two levels: "oile" and "tmxtso". The mpsi factor consists of two levels: "elxlc" and "zim". The qqsuu factor consists of two levels: "oile" and "tmxtso".
The zyhs factor depends on the regular factors qqsuu and rzadpo and has two levels: "fxyqp" and "nljia". A trial is considered "fxyqp" if the qqsuu matches the rzadpo, otherwise, it is considered "nljia".
We crossed the rzadpo and the tcx factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that no more than 4 of the same zyhs transitions could occur in a row.
