There are four regular factors: bvtai, lembv, tfo, and jerk. The bvtai factor consists of two levels: "pvuel" and "slfm". The lembv factor consists of two levels: "wfibz" and "tryd". The tfo factor consists of two levels: "pvuel" and "slfm". The jerk factor consists of two levels: "wfibz" and "tryd". The bvtai and tfo factors are crossed. The minimum number of trials is 58.
We crossed the tfo and the bvtai factor. All experiment sequences contained at least 58 trials.
