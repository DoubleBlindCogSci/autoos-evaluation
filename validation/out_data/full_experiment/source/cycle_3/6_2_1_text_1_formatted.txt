### REGULAR FACTORS
There are six regular factors: avbwpg, xzx, qrtckt, zomk, dergv, and ubzdcu. The avbwpg factor consists of two levels: "cimg" and "hbfe". The xzx factor consists of two levels: "fsk" and "nnbtc". The qrtckt factor consists of two levels: "cimg" and "hbfe". The zomk factor consists of two levels: "fsk" and "nnbtc". The dergv factor consists of two levels: "sxzdej" and "rxwuo". The ubzdcu factor consists of two levels: "vdom" and "mqg".
### DERIVED FACTORS
There are two derived factors: ftmaw and upva.
## ftmaw
The ftmaw factor depends on the xzx and ubzdcu factors and has two levels: "nch" and "mfdpop". A trial is considered "nch" if the xzx matches the ubzdcu, otherwise, it is considered "mfdpop".
## upva
The upva factor depends on the qrtckt and dergv factors and has two levels: "gukug" and "bseu". A trial is considered "gukug" if the qrtckt matches the dergv, otherwise, it is considered "bseu".
### EXPERIMENT
We crossed the dergv and the zomk factor. All experiment sequences contained at least 29 trials.
