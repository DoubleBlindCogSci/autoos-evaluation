There are five regular factors: wxkp, fgiigi, vmp, fzb, and kpdy. The wxkp factor consists of two levels: "iqsqug" and "ygc". The fgiigi factor consists of two levels: "ukk" and "nojgu". The vmp factor consists of two levels: "iqsqug" and "ygc". The fzb factor consists of two levels: "ukk" and "nojgu". The kpdy factor consists of two levels: "hkoia" and "mploi".
The gdzodz factor depends on the vmp and fzb factors and has two levels: "mwod" and "blf". If the vmp is equal to the fzb, then the trial is considered "mwod". Otherwise, the trial is considered "blf".
The bbo factor depends on the fgiigi and wxkp factors and has two levels: "dxh" and "hox". A trial is considered "dxh" if the fgiigi matches the wxkp, otherwise, it is considered "hox".
We crossed the fzb and the gdzodz factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to two constraints. First, we allowed for no more than 2 of the same fgiigi transitions in a row. Second, we allowed for at least 3 of the same gdzodz transitions in a row.
