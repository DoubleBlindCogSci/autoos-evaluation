There are six regular factors: jjywqq, tjwatw, eayq, zlt, wgjkb, and gmrf. The jjywqq factor consists of two levels: "ybtpmi" and "lqlydm". The tjwatw factor consists of two levels: "qezqa" and "dypoob". The eayq factor consists of two levels: "ybtpmi" and "lqlydm". The zlt factor consists of two levels: "qezqa" and "dypoob". The wgjkb factor consists of two levels: "vajuv" and "kapoyj". The gmrf factor consists of two levels: "licx" and "qgi".
The gho factor depends on the gmrf and zlt factors and has two levels: "dnvcxo" and "fhuy". If the gmrf factor matches the zlt factor, then the trial is considered "dnvcxo". Otherwise, the trial is considered "fhuy".
The tvz factor depends on the wgjkb and tjwatw factors and has two levels: "wsalj" and "lopa". A trial is considered "wsalj" if the wgjkb factor matches the tjwatw factor, otherwise, it is considered "lopa".
We crossed the eayq and the gho factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that exactly 2 trials with the level "qezqa" in the tjwatw factor occured. All experiment sequences contained at least 25 trials.
