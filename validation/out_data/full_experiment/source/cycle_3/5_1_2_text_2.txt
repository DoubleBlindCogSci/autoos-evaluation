There are six regular factors: mhwfb, xdpvuw, jtlrt, ior, nhulxc, and mps. The mhwfb factor consists of two levels: "nqfkbi" and "hvatw". The xdpvuw factor consists of two levels: "xmkm" and "mbz". The jtlrt factor consists of two levels: "nqfkbi" and "hvatw". The ior factor consists of two levels: "xmkm" and "mbz". The nhulxc factor consists of two levels: "ffqhy" and "ydycxv". The mps factor consists of two levels: "yunbbk" and "gpiev". The mps factor is a derived factor. The level "yunbbk" is derived from the levels of the xdpvuw and jtlrt factors. The level "gpiev" is derived from the levels of the xdpvuw and jtlrt factors.
The mps factor depends on the xdpvuw and jtlrt factors and has two levels: "yunbbk" and "gpiev". A trial is considered "yunbbk" if the xdpvuw matches the jtlrt, otherwise, it is considered "gpiev".
We crossed the xdpvuw factor with the mps factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that no more than 4 of the same mhwfb transitions could occur in a row. All experiment sequences contained at least 26 trials.
