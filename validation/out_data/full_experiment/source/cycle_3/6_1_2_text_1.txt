There are six regular factors: kgx, ujbe, cbiwgn, tqlnk, pdhel, and sfe. The kgx factor consists of two levels: "rxrgv" and "xdqhc". The ujbe factor consists of two levels: "jaehg" and "gmnopl". The cbiwgn factor consists of two levels: "rxrgv" and "xdqhc". The tqlnk factor consists of two levels: "jaehg" and "gmnopl". The pdhel factor consists of two levels: "hpziox" and "wisqo". The sfe factor consists of two levels: "nep" and "oqcus".
The latl factor depends on the pdhel and ujbe factors and has two levels: "dgcdsk" and "zxrpht". A trial is considered "dgcdsk" if the pdhel matches the ujbe, otherwise, it is considered "zxrpht".
We crossed the cbiwgn and the latl factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to two constraints. First, we allowed for no more than 2 of the same sfe transitions in a row. Second, we allowed for at least 2 of the same ujbe transitions in a row.
