There are seven regular factors: byds, zqhjpa, ppktzu, bwci, rxukub, cznezw, and gabz. The byds factor consists of two levels: "wnsa" and "pbvws". The zqhjpa factor consists of two levels: "auo" and "ikosc". The ppktzu factor consists of two levels: "wnsa" and "pbvws". The bwci factor consists of two levels: "auo" and "ikosc". The rxukub factor consists of two levels: "txxm" and "yojoxb". The cznezw factor consists of two levels: "fzjgi" and "qpqg". The gabz factor consists of two levels: "grwuc" and "tysmu".
The cznezw factor depends on the bwci and rxukub factors and has two levels: "fzjgi" and "qpqg". A trial is considered "fzjgi" if the bwci factor matches the rxukub factor, otherwise, it is considered "qpqg".
The gabz factor depends on the byds and zqhjpa factors and has two levels: "grwuc" and "tysmu". A trial is considered "grwuc" if the byds matches the zqhjpa, otherwise, it is considered "tysmu".
We crossed the byds and the ppktzu factor.
