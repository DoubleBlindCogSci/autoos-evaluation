There are six regular factors: dcoelt, wohi, zhzxp, bsp, ryvm, and uzbpmj. The dcoelt factor consists of two levels: "trehz" and "wrla". The wohi factor consists of two levels: "kjz" and "tnks". The zhzxp factor consists of two levels: "trehz" and "wrla". The bsp factor consists of two levels: "kjz" and "tnks". The ryvm factor consists of two levels: "mdvu" and "sbgra". The uzbpmj factor consists of two levels: "ehyn" and "vslmq".
The ryvm factor depends on the dcoelt and wohi factors and has two levels: "mdvu" and "sbgra". A trial is considered "mdvu" if the dcoelt matches the wohi, otherwise, it is considered "sbgra".
The uzbpmj factor depends on the zhzxp and bsp factors and has two levels: "ehyn" and "vslmq". If the zhzxp factor matches the bsp factor, then the trial is considered "ehyn". Otherwise, the trial is considered "vslmq".
We crossed the dcoelt and the zhzxp factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that at least 45 trials were included.
