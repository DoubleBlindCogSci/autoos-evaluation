There are five regular factors: ckt, smu, psn, tpk, and eyzwf. The ckt factor consists of two levels: "ypkjl" and "yitd". The smu factor consists of two levels: "xbeqh" and "albh". The psn factor consists of two levels: "ypkjl" and "yitd". The tpk factor consists of two levels: "xbeqh" and "albh". The eyzwf factor consists of two levels: "oyjyxm" and "rsk".
The erm factor depends on the smu and psn factors and has two levels: "qhb" and "hqdkzn". A trial is considered "qhb" if the smu matches the psn, otherwise, it is considered "hqdkzn".
The rrlxc factor depends on the eyzwf and tpk factors and has two levels: "mpm" and "gyei". A trial is considered "mpm" if the eyzwf matches the tpk, otherwise, it is considered "gyei".
We crossed the smu and the psn factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that exactly 4 trials with the level "ypkjl" in the psn factor occured in a row.
