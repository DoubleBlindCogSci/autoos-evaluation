There are five regular factors: lno, tula, ygadz, qxlh, and xkx. The lno factor consists of two levels: "sudp" and "nogr". The tula factor consists of two levels: "bkcad" and "cjm". The ygadz factor consists of two levels: "sudp" and "nogr". The qxlh factor consists of two levels: "bkcad" and "cjm". The xkx factor consists of two levels: "ezcq" and "wgybo". The xkx factor is a derived factor. The level "ezcq" is derived from the levels of the tula and lno factors. The level "wgybo" is derived from the levels of the tula and lno factors. The design is a cross block design. The crossing factors are qxlh and xkx. The constraints are: At least three trials in a row with the level "bkcad" of the tula factor and at least 28 trials.
The xkx factor depends on the tula and lno factors and has two levels: "ezcq" and "wgybo". If the tula factor matches the lno factor, then the trial is considered "ezcq". Otherwise, the trial is considered "wgybo".
We crossed the qxlh and the xkx factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that at least 3 trials with the level "bkcad" in the tula factor occured. All experiment sequences contained at least 28 trials.
