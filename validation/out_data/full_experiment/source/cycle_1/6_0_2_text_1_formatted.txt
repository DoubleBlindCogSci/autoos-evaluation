### REGULAR FACTORS
There are six regular factors: pohbz, edcx, yoma, wmhjq, wegj, and fdhif. The pohbz factor consists of two levels: "bpev" and "kiujoc". The edcx factor consists of two levels: "tyc" and "yunio". The yoma factor consists of two levels: "bpev" and "kiujoc". The wmhjq factor consists of two levels: "tyc" and "yunio". The wegj factor consists of two levels: "mbg" and "xpjjgv". The fdhif factor consists of two levels: "atcbho" and "ziqlyq".
### EXPERIMENT
We crossed the yoma and the edcx factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that at least 3 trials with the level "atcbho" in the fdhif factor occured in a row. All experiment sequences contained at least 50 trials.
