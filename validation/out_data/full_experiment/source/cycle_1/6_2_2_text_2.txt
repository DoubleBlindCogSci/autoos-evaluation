There are six regular factors: rzazt, mfxmh, lejbn, yseb, skpifo, and dfaag. The rzazt factor consists of two levels: "yfjy" and "qcomsb". The mfxmh factor consists of two levels: "njui" and "kbdq". The lejbn factor consists of two levels: "yfjy" and "qcomsb". The yseb factor consists of two levels: "njui" and "kbdq". The skpifo factor consists of two levels: "syy" and "pvbing". The dfaag factor consists of two levels: "mtd" and "zma". There are two derived factors: yrx and sgguq. The yrx factor consists of two levels: "uam" and "pbcmbd". The sgguq factor consists of two levels: "zsknwg" and "xua". The yrx factor is derived from the dfaag and mfxmh factors. The sgguq factor is derived from the yseb and lejbn factors. The lejbn and yseb factors are crossed. The dfaag factor has a maximum of three consecutive trials. The block has a minimum of 46 trials.
The yrx factor depends on the dfaag and mfxmh factors and has two levels: "uam" and "pbcmbd". A trial is considered "uam" if the dfaag factor matches the mfxmh factor, otherwise, it is considered "pbcmbd".
The sgguq factor depends on the yseb and lejbn factors and has two levels: "zsknwg" and "xua". A trial is considered "zsknwg" if the yseb factor matches the lejbn factor, otherwise, it is considered "xua".
We crossed the lejbn and the yseb factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that no more than 3 of the same dfaag transitions could occur in a row. All experiment sequences contained at least 46 trials.
