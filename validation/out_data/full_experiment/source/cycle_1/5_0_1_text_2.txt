There are five regular factors: unrxx, vvdgwd, fbr, fqyzr, and qqgqvy. The unrxx factor consists of two levels: "juabnh" and "gbnqm". The vvdgwd factor consists of two levels: "ccwoqj" and "zevijt". The fbr factor consists of two levels: "juabnh" and "gbnqm". The fqyzr factor consists of two levels: "ccwoqj" and "zevijt". The qqgqvy factor consists of two levels: "jmterk" and "ripcij". There is one constraint: At least four "jmterk" levels in a row. The crossing factors are unrxx and fbr.
We crossed the unrxx and the fbr factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that at least 4 trials with the level "jmterk" in the qqgqvy factor occured in a row.
