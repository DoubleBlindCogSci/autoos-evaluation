There are five regular factors: qbels, zafcwt, gkvi, kfzgby, and dpzavt. The qbels factor consists of two levels: "fedyp" and "qvtee". The zafcwt factor consists of two levels: "jkyqe" and "hvpzy". The gkvi factor consists of two levels: "fedyp" and "qvtee". The kfzgby factor consists of two levels: "jkyqe" and "hvpzy". The dpzavt factor consists of two levels: "vnmzjk" and "vpgjkg". There are two derived factors: hwyre and dfznp. The hwyre factor consists of two levels: "zdvnk" and "mxo". The dfznp factor consists of two levels: "gkkww" and "vxtxq". There are two constraints: Exactly three times in a row the level "fedyp" of the factor "qbels" must occur. At least four times in a row the level "jkyqe" of the factor "kfzgby" must occur. The factors "dfznp" and "zafcwt" are crossed.
The hwyre factor depends on the kfzgby and gkvi factors and has two levels: "zdvnk" and "mxo". A trial is considered "zdvnk" if the kfzgby factor matches the gkvi factor, otherwise, it is considered "mxo".
The dfznp factor depends on the zafcwt and dpzavt factors and has two levels: "gkkww" and "vxtxq". A trial is considered "gkkww" if the zafcwt matches the dpzavt, otherwise, it is considered "vxtxq".
We crossed the qbels and the zafcwt factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that exactly 3 trials with the level "fedyp" in the qbels factor occured. Also, there were always at least 4 trials in a row with the level "jkyqe" in the kfzgby factor.
