There are six regular factors: gqw, wdp, nrbavq, xlpll, xne, and cee. The gqw factor consists of two levels: "ohpe" and "rbclng". The wdp factor consists of two levels: "eioqw" and "rrvin". The nrbavq factor consists of two levels: "ohpe" and "rbclng". The xlpll factor consists of two levels: "eioqw" and "rrvin". The xne factor consists of two levels: "erjk" and "yow". The cee factor consists of two levels: "yqzavs" and "gof".
The zzsf factor depends on the nrbavq and wdp factors and has two levels: "cmjwd" and "yffeb". A trial is considered "cmjwd" if the nrbavq matches the wdp, otherwise, it is considered "yffeb".
We crossed the nrbavq and the cee factor. All experiment sequences contained at least 39 trials.
