### REGULAR FACTORS
There are six regular factors: rzazt, mfxmh, lejbn, yseb, skpifo, and dfaag. The rzazt factor consists of two levels: "yfjy" and "qcomsb". The mfxmh factor consists of two levels: "njui" and "kbdq". The lejbn factor consists of two levels: "yfjy" and "qcomsb". The yseb factor consists of two levels: "njui" and "kbdq". The skpifo factor consists of two levels: "syy" and "pvbing". The dfaag factor consists of two levels: "mtd" and "zma".
### DERIVED FACTORS
There are two derived factors: yrx and sgguq.
## yrx
The yrx factor depends on the dfaag and mfxmh factors and has two levels: "uam" and "pbcmbd". A trial is considered "uam" if the dfaag matches the mfxmh, otherwise, it is considered "pbcmbd".
## sgguq
The sgguq factor depends on the yseb and lejbn factors and has two levels: "zsknwg" and "xua". A trial is considered "zsknwg" if the yseb matches the lejbn, otherwise, it is considered "xua".
### EXPERIMENT
We crossed the lejbn and the yseb factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that no more than 3 of the same dfaag could occur in a row. All experiment sequences contained at least 46 trials.
