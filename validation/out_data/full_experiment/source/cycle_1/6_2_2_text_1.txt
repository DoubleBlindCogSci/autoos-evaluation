There are six regular factors: rzazt, mfxmh, lejbn, yseb, skpifo, and dfaag. The rzazt factor consists of two levels: "yfjy" and "qcomsb". The mfxmh factor consists of two levels: "njui" and "kbdq". The lejbn factor consists of two levels: "yfjy" and "qcomsb". The yseb factor consists of two levels: "njui" and "kbdq". The skpifo factor consists of two levels: "syy" and "pvbing". The dfaag factor consists of two levels: "mtd" and "zma".
The yrx factor depends on the dfaag and mfxmh factors and has two levels: "uam" and "pbcmbd". A trial is considered "uam" if the dfaag matches the mfxmh, otherwise, it is considered "pbcmbd".
The sgguq factor depends on the yseb and lejbn factors and has two levels: "zsknwg" and "xua". A trial is considered "zsknwg" if the yseb matches the lejbn, otherwise, it is considered "xua".
We crossed the lejbn and the yseb factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that no more than 3 of the same dfaag could occur in a row. All experiment sequences contained at least 46 trials.
