There are five regular factors: kbj, npycyx, ltjqdz, dbb, and tdpseh. The kbj factor consists of two levels: "jnhscz" and "enmgky". The npycyx factor consists of two levels: "xbz" and "pjtbin". The ltjqdz factor consists of two levels: "jnhscz" and "enmgky". The dbb factor consists of two levels: "xbz" and "pjtbin". The tdpseh factor consists of two levels: "zgn" and "sfu". The tdpseh factor is crossed with the npycyx factor. The tdpseh factor is also constrained to have at least three trials in a row. The design has a minimum of 26 trials.
We crossed the npycyx factor with the tdpseh factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that at least 3 trials in a row with the level "zgn" in the tdpseh factor occured. All experiment sequences contained at least 26 trials.
