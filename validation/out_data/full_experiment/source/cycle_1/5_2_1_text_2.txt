There are seven regular factors: mojan, odmmgw, xbk, kvkn, pypwky, qsms, and jlt. The mojan factor consists of two levels: "nwu" and "psksh". The odmmgw factor consists of two levels: "gji" and "vois". The xbk factor consists of two levels: "nwu" and "psksh". The kvkn factor consists of two levels: "gji" and "vois". The pypwky factor consists of two levels: "rmnym" and "pthd". The qsms factor consists of two levels: "czo" and "ohxl". The jlt factor consists of two levels: "szftzq" and "ncfc".
The qsms factor depends on the mojan and odmmgw factors and has two levels: "czo" and "ohxl". A trial is considered "czo" if the mojan factor matches the odmmgw factor, otherwise, it is considered "ohxl".
The jlt factor depends on the xbk and pypwky factors and has two levels: "szftzq" and "ncfc". A trial is considered "szftzq" if the xbk factor matches the pypwky factor, otherwise, it is considered "ncfc".
We crossed the mojan and the odmmgw factor. We also crossed the xbk and the kvkn factor. We crossed the pypwky factor with the qsms and the jlt factor. The experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that no more than 4 of the same qsms could occur in a row.
