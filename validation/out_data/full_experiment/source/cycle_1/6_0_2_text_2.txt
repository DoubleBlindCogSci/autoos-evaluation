There are six regular factors: pohbz, edcx, yoma, wmhjq, wegj, and fdhif. The pohbz factor consists of two levels: "bpev" and "kiujoc". The edcx factor consists of two levels: "tyc" and "yunio". The yoma factor consists of two levels: "bpev" and "kiujoc". The wmhjq factor consists of two levels: "tyc" and "yunio". The wegj factor consists of two levels: "mbg" and "xpjjgv". The fdhif factor consists of two levels: "atcbho" and "ziqlyq". The pohbz and edcx factors are crossed. The yoma and wmhjq factors are crossed. The wegj factor is not crossed with any other factor. The fdhif factor is not crossed with any other factor. The fdhif factor has the constraint that the level "atcbho" must appear at least three times in a row. The fdhif factor has the constraint that the level "atcbho" must appear at least fifty times.
We crossed the yoma and the edcx factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that at least 3 trials with the level "atcbho" in the fdhif factor occured. All experiment sequences contained at least 50 trials.
