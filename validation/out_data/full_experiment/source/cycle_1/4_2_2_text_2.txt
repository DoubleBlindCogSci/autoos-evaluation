There are six regular factors: kwvw, vsgmy, muv, pdajd, rlhkr, and tkkanm. The kwvw factor consists of two levels: "ltprq" and "busur". The vsgmy factor consists of two levels: "dry" and "affc". The muv factor consists of two levels: "ltprq" and "busur". The pdajd factor consists of two levels: "dry" and "affc". The rlhkr factor consists of two levels: "heml" and "cepv". The tkkanm factor consists of two levels: "qgxcm" and "ggwik".
The rlhkr factor depends on the vsgmy and pdajd factors and has two levels: "heml" and "cepv". A trial is considered "heml" if the vsgmy factor matches the pdajd factor, otherwise, it is considered "cepv".
The tkkanm factor depends on the muv and kwvw factors and has two levels: "qgxcm" and "ggwik". A trial is considered "qgxcm" if the muv matches the kwvw, otherwise, it is considered "ggwik".
We crossed the vsgmy and the tkkanm factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that exactly 2 trials with the level "dry" in the vsgmy factor occured in a row. Also, there were at most 2 trials in a row with the level "affc" in the pdajd factor.
