### REGULAR FACTORS
There are five regular factors: qbels, zafcwt, gkvi, kfzgby, and dpzavt. The qbels factor consists of two levels: "fedyp" and "qvtee". The zafcwt factor consists of two levels: "jkyqe" and "hvpzy". The gkvi factor consists of two levels: "fedyp" and "qvtee". The kfzgby factor consists of two levels: "jkyqe" and "hvpzy". The dpzavt factor consists of two levels: "vnmzjk" and "vpgjkg".
### DERIVED FACTORS
There are two derived factors: hwyre and dfznp.
## hwyre
The hwyre factor depends on the kfzgby and gkvi factors and has two levels: "zdvnk" and "mxo". A trial is considered "zdvnk" if the kfzgby factor matches the gkvi factor, otherwise, it is considered "mxo".
## dfznp
The dfznp factor depends on the zafcwt and dpzavt factors and has two levels: "gkkww" and "vxtxq". If the zafcwt factor matches the dpzavt factor, then the trial is considered a "gkkww". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "vxtxq".
### EXPERIMENT
We crossed the dfznp and the zafcwt factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that exactly 3 trials with the level "fedyp" in the qbels factor occured in a row. Also, there were always at least 4 trials in a row with the level "jkyqe" in the kfzgby factor.
