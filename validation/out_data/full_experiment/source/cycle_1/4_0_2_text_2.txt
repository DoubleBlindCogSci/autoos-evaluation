There are four regular factors: vrern, nfi, esewp, and ffr. The vrern factor consists of two levels: "ofdjhs" and "ansm". The nfi factor consists of two levels: "ofxmh" and "lyvsf". The esewp factor consists of two levels: "ofdjhs" and "ansm". The ffr factor consists of two levels: "ofxmh" and "lyvsf". There are two constraints: At most three of the levels "ofdjhs" and "ansm" of the esewp factor can occur in a row. At least four of the levels "ofxmh" and "lyvsf" of the ffr factor must occur in a row. The esewp and ffr factors cross each other.
We crossed the ffr and the esewp factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to two constraints. First, we allowed for no more than 3 of the same esewp transitions in a row. Second, we allowed for at least 4 of the same ffr transitions in a row.
