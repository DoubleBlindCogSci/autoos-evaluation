There are four regular factors: kwvw, vsgmy, muv, and pdajd. The kwvw factor consists of two levels: "ltprq" and "busur". The vsgmy factor also consists of two levels: "dry" and "affc". The muv factor consists of two levels: "ltprq" and "busur". The pdajd factor also consists of two levels: "dry" and "affc".
The rlhkr factor depends on the vsgmy and pdajd factors and has two levels: "heml" and "cepv". A trial is considered "heml" if the vsgmy matches the pdajd, otherwise, it is considered "cepv".
The tkkanm factor depends on the muv and kwvw factors and has two levels: "qgxcm" and "ggwik". A trial is considered "qgxcm" if the muv matches the kwvw, otherwise, it is considered "ggwik".
We crossed the vsgmy and the tkkanm factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to two constraints. First, there were always exactly two trials in a row with the level "dry" in the vsgmy factor. Second, there were never more than two trials in a row with the level "affc" in the pdajd factor.
