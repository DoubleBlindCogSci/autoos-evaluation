There are six regular factors: wwr, dnj, oskly, kny, wgpxd, and bamy. The wwr factor consists of two levels: "tbuiey" and "yytduo". The dnj factor consists of two levels: "qarhs" and "dxt". The oskly factor consists of two levels: "tbuiey" and "yytduo". The kny factor consists of two levels: "qarhs" and "dxt". The wgpxd factor consists of two levels: "irlh" and "cawso". The bamy factor consists of two levels: "qdmmba" and "ueqq". There are two derived factors: rqrk and sppmi. The rqrk factor consists of two levels: "gqu" and "rrpfp". The sppmi factor consists of two levels: "wzd" and "pnrapu". The oskly and wwr factors are crossed. The dnj factor is constrained to have at most two levels in a row.
The rqrk factor depends on the kny and bamy factors and has two levels: "gqu" and "rrpfp". A trial is considered "gqu" if the kny factor matches the bamy factor, otherwise, it is considered "rrpfp".
The sppmi factor depends on the wwr and oskly factors and has two levels: "wzd" and "pnrapu". A trial is considered "wzd" if the wwr matches the oskly, otherwise, it is considered "pnrapu".
We crossed the oskly and the wwr factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that no more than 2 of the same dnj transitions could occur in a row.
