### REGULAR FACTORS
There are six regular factors: wwr, dnj, oskly, kny, wgpxd, and bamy. The wwr factor consists of two levels: "tbuiey" and "yytduo". The dnj factor consists of two levels: "qarhs" and "dxt". The oskly factor consists of two levels: "tbuiey" and "yytduo". The kny factor consists of two levels: "qarhs" and "dxt". The wgpxd factor consists of two levels: "irlh" and "cawso". The bamy factor consists of two levels: "qdmmba" and "ueqq".
### DERIVED FACTORS
There are two derived factors: rqrk and sppmi.
## rqrk
The rqrk factor depends on the kny and bamy factors and has two levels: "gqu" and "rrpfp". A trial is considered "gqu" if the kny factor matches the bamy factor, otherwise, it is considered "rrpfp".
## sppmi
The sppmi factor depends on the wwr and oskly factors and has two levels: "wzd" and "pnrapu". A trial is considered "wzd" if the wwr matches the oskly, otherwise, it is considered "pnrapu".
### EXPERIMENT
We crossed the oskly and the wwr factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that no more than 2 of the same dnj transitions could occur in a row.
