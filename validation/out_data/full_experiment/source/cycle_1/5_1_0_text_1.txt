There are five regular factors: kxk, oqba, voo, wtq, and isf. The kxk factor consists of two levels: "nllpb" and "nhg". The oqba factor consists of two levels: "bdalt" and "xjsf". The voo factor consists of two levels: "nllpb" and "nhg". The wtq factor consists of two levels: "bdalt" and "xjsf". The isf factor consists of two levels: "lavu" and "tqntet".
The vceeea factor depends on the voo and oqba factors and has two levels: "rpds" and "rth". If the voo factor matches the oqba factor, then the trial is considered a "rpds". Otherwise, the trial is considered a "rth".
We crossed the kxk and the voo factor.
