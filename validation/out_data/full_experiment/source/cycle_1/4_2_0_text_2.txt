There are six regular factors: qzek, wvzc, pejrm, gyi, ljk, and htotnl. The qzek factor consists of two levels: "obt" and "crkyja". The wvzc factor consists of two levels: "gcwqk" and "bpufk". The pejrm factor consists of two levels: "obt" and "crkyja". The gyi factor consists of two levels: "gcwqk" and "bpufk". The ljk factor consists of two levels: "kxcbx" and "qcge". The htotnl factor consists of two levels: "thnf" and "iacvkn".
The ljk factor depends on the qzek and wvzc factors and has two levels: "kxcbx" and "qcge". A trial is considered "kxcbx" if the qzek matches the wvzc, otherwise, it is considered "qcge".
The htotnl factor depends on the gyi and pejrm factors and has two levels: "thnf" and "iacvkn". A trial is considered "thnf" if the gyi factor matches the pejrm factor, otherwise, it is considered "iacvkn".
We crossed the qzek and the wvzc factor. We also crossed the pejrm and the gyi factor.
