There are six regular factors: ptxf, fthd, lln, lfcap, tku, and rvpgn. The ptxf factor consists of two levels: "nsmjwr" and "iqbzt". The fthd factor consists of two levels: "fuezsy" and "ddldqs". The lln factor consists of two levels: "nsmjwr" and "iqbzt". The lfcap factor consists of two levels: "fuezsy" and "ddldqs". The tku factor consists of two levels: "qupefs" and "nbo". The rvpgn factor consists of two levels: "pysk" and "ihgxhj". There is one derived factor: hjkr. The hjkr factor consists of two levels: "xwex" and "cidq". The hjkr factor is derived from the lfcap and fthd factors. The hjkr factor is a within-trial factor.
The hjkr factor depends on the lfcap and fthd factors and has two levels: "xwex" and "cidq". A trial is considered "xwex" if the lfcap factor matches the fthd factor, otherwise, it is considered "cidq".
We crossed the fthd and the tku factor.
