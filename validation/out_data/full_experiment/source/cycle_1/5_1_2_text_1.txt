There are five regular factors: loslz, odd, mefc, hkki, and oju. The loslz factor consists of two levels: "acnxo" and "igqh". The odd factor consists of two levels: "bojkc" and "phe". The mefc factor consists of two levels: "acnxo" and "igqh". The hkki factor consists of two levels: "bojkc" and "phe". The oju factor consists of two levels: "vsw" and "xfg".
The djawfc factor depends on the oju and hkki factors and has two levels: "clt" and "pkadp". If the oju factor matches the hkki factor, then the trial is considered "clt". Otherwise, the trial is considered "pkadp".
We crossed the djawfc and the hkki factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that at least 4 trials with the level "pkadp" in the mefc factor occured in a row. All experiment sequences contained at least 27 trials.
