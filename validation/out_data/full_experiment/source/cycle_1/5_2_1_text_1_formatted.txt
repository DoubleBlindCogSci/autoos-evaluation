### REGULAR FACTORS
There are five regular factors: mojan, odmmgw, xbk, kvkn, and pypwky. The mojan factor consists of two levels: "nwu" and "psksh". The odmmgw factor also consists of two levels: "gji" and "vois". The xbk factor consists of two levels: "nwu" and "psksh". The kvkn factor also consists of two levels: "gji" and "vois". The pypwky factor consists of two levels: "rmnym" and "pthd".
### DERIVED FACTORS
There are two derived factors: qsms and jlt.
## qsms
The qsms factor depends on the mojan and odmmgw factors and has two levels: "czo" and "ohxl". A trial is considered "czo" if the mojan matches the odmmgw, otherwise, it is considered "ohxl".
## jlt
The jlt factor depends on the xbk and pypwky factors and has two levels: "szftzq" and "ncfc". A trial is considered "szftzq" if the xbk matches the pypwky, otherwise, it is considered "ncfc".
### EXPERIMENT
We crossed the jlt and the qsms factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that no more than 4 of the same qsms transitions could occur in a row.
