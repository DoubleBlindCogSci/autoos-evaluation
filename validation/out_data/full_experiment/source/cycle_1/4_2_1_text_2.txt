There are six regular factors: zzdmwj, gkn, evz, toiht, khvnl, and fdan. The zzdmwj factor consists of two levels: "ioetr" and "jlbmqt". The gkn factor consists of two levels: "ocdj" and "ovk". The evz factor consists of two levels: "ioetr" and "jlbmqt". The toiht factor consists of two levels: "ocdj" and "ovk". The khvnl factor consists of two levels: "kknbk" and "gebdr". The fdan factor consists of two levels: "cjjghi" and "urts".
The khvnl factor depends on the evz and zzdmwj factors and has two levels: "kknbk" and "gebdr". A trial is considered "kknbk" if the evz matches the zzdmwj, otherwise, it is considered "gebdr".
The fdan factor depends on the gkn and toiht factors and has two levels: "cjjghi" and "urts". A trial is considered "cjjghi" if the gkn matches the toiht, otherwise, it is considered "urts".
We crossed the zzdmwj and the gkn factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that at least 2 trials with the level "ioetr" in the evz factor were in a row.
