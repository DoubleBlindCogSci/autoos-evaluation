There are five regular factors: hcwl, mdvxwl, sql, mjwrx, and iaa. The hcwl factor consists of two levels: "yuf" and "mso". The mdvxwl factor consists of two levels: "ywadjh" and "fskl". The sql factor consists of two levels: "yuf" and "mso". The mjwrx factor consists of two levels: "ywadjh" and "fskl". The iaa factor consists of two levels: "uqbw" and "gwzp". There is one derived factor: uid. The uid factor consists of two levels: "nfp" and "waj". The uid factor is derived from the sql and mdvxwl factors. The uid factor is defined as follows: If the sql factor is equal to the mdvxwl factor, then the uid factor is "nfp". Otherwise, the uid factor is "waj". There is one constraint: Exactly two "waj" levels in a row. The constraint applies to the mjwrx factor. The uid factor and the hcwl factor are crossed.
The uid factor depends on the sql and mdvxwl factors and has two levels: "nfp" and "waj". A trial is considered "nfp" if the sql matches the mdvxwl, otherwise, it is considered "waj".
We crossed the hcwl and the mdvxwl factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that exactly 2 trials with the level "waj" in the mjwrx factor occured in a row.
