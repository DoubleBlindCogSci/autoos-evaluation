There are four regular factors: bwiy, duutsq, gjhyl, and gkp. The bwiy factor consists of two levels: "nkk" and "wpgc". The duutsq factor also consists of two levels: "kwt" and "aovg". The gjhyl factor consists of two levels: "nkk" and "wpgc". The gkp factor consists of two levels: "kwt" and "aovg".
The ulbw factor depends on the gjhyl and duutsq factors and has two levels: "ygc" and "kuut". If the gjhyl factor matches the duutsq factor, then the trial is considered "ygc". Otherwise, the trial is considered "kuut".
We crossed the ulbw and the gkp factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that no more than 4 of the same bwiy transitions could occur in a row.
