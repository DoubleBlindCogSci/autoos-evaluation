There are five regular factors: mogppw, ygz, jxmg, zuxak, and imj. The mogppw factor consists of two levels: "nsmj" and "hbav". The ygz factor consists of two levels: "lloiv" and "epic". The jxmg factor consists of two levels: "nsmj" and "hbav". The zuxak factor consists of two levels: "lloiv" and "epic". The imj factor consists of two levels: "pkq" and "aeiu". There is one derived factor: iaf. The iaf factor consists of two levels: "pgzwhl" and "acco". The iaf factor is defined as follows: The "pgzwhl" level is defined as the level where the zuxak factor is equal to the ygz factor. The "acco" level is defined as the level where the zuxak factor is not equal to the ygz factor. There are two constraints: The first constraint is that there must be at least 27 trials. The second constraint is that the level "nsmj" of the mogppw factor must occur exactly four times. There is one crossing: The jxmg factor crosses with the zuxak factor.
The iaf factor depends on the zuxak and ygz factors and has two levels: "pgzwhl" and "acco". A trial is considered "pgzwhl" if the zuxak factor matches the ygz factor. Otherwise, the trial is considered "acco".
We crossed the jxmg and the zuxak factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that exactly 4 trials with the level "nsmj" in the mogppw factor occured. All experiment sequences contained at least 27 trials.
