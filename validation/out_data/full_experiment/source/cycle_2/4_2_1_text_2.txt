There are four regular factors: oxt, jvg, moskvk, and ijmr. The oxt factor consists of two levels: "sivho" and "cqbgic". The jvg factor also consists of two levels: "ohs" and "wpyrc". The moskvk factor consists of two levels: "sivho" and "cqbgic". The ijmr factor also consists of two levels: "ohs" and "wpyrc". There are two derived factors: knmejn and imxuu. The knmejn factor consists of two levels: "dhmqoa" and "tgtul". The imxuu factor also consists of two levels: "ajirpt" and "nozlj". There is one constraint: At most two oxt levels can occur in a row. There is one crossing: moskvk and oxt.
The knmejn factor depends on the ijmr and moskvk factors and has two levels: "dhmqoa" and "tgtul". A trial is considered "dhmqoa" if the ijmr matches the moskvk, otherwise, it is considered "tgtul".
The imxuu factor depends on the oxt and jvg factors and has two levels: "ajirpt" and "nozlj". A trial is considered "ajirpt" if the oxt matches the jvg, otherwise, it is considered "nozlj".
We crossed the oxt and the moskvk factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that no more than 2 of the same oxt transitions could occur in a row.
