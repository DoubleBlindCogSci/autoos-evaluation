There are four regular factors: crs, iaqirv, ivfjrc, and auc. The crs factor consists of two levels: "pmg" and "qkb". The iaqirv factor consists of two levels: "qvcp" and "xxpwn". The ivfjrc factor consists of two levels: "pmg" and "qkb". The auc factor consists of two levels: "qvcp" and "xxpwn". There are two derived factors: iuovx and mrqv. The iuovx factor consists of two levels: "nqlgn" and "iaajvq". The mrqv factor consists of two levels: "uegs" and "hhguew". The iuovx factor is derived from the crs and auc factors. The mrqv factor is derived from the iaqirv and ivfjrc factors.
The iuovx factor depends on the crs and auc factors and has two levels: "nqlgn" and "iaajvq". A trial is considered "nqlgn" if the crs matches the auc, otherwise, it is considered "iaajvq".
The mrqv factor depends on the iaqirv and ivfjrc factors and has two levels: "uegs" and "hhguew". A trial is considered "uegs" if the iaqirv matches the ivfjrc. Otherwise, the trial is considered "hhguew".
We crossed the crs and the mrqv factor.
