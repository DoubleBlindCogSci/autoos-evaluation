There are six regular factors: cxac, byvob, ayfgq, tnd, uwgbrp, and phb. The cxac factor consists of two levels: "alpai" and "mdiei". The byvob factor also consists of two levels: "juc" and "bzdi". The ayfgq factor consists of two levels: "alpai" and "mdiei". The tnd factor also consists of two levels: "juc" and "bzdi". The uwgbrp factor consists of two levels: "gnyajh" and "bqg". The phb factor also consists of two levels: "mjyfwo" and "jea".
The funv factor depends on the factors phb and uwgbrp and has two levels: "jrhlqv" and "axyuo". A trial is considered "jrhlqv" if the phb matches the uwgbrp, otherwise, it is considered "axyuo".
The bkcnhy factor depends on the cxac and tnd factors and has two levels: "cfae" and "ljbbi". If the cxac is equal to the tnd, then the trial is "cfae". Otherwise, the trial is "ljbbi".
We crossed the cxac and the byvob factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to two constraints. First, there were always at least 3 trials in a row with the level "juc" in the byvob factor. Second, there were never more than 4 trials in a row with the level "gnyajh" in the uwgbrp factor.
