There are five regular factors: rdofu, knakml, qnpxs, vwpw, and dyti. The rdofu factor consists of two levels: "pyobz" and "ofkrum". The knakml factor consists of two levels: "qubuk" and "dok". The qnpxs factor consists of two levels: "pyobz" and "ofkrum". The vwpw factor consists of two levels: "qubuk" and "dok". The dyti factor consists of two levels: "hpcxbk" and "nfp". There are two derived factors: qad and kho. The qad factor consists of two levels: "iast" and "mlsvfv". The kho factor consists of two levels: "eedltm" and "ived".
The qad factor depends on the knakml and dyti factors and has two levels: "iast" and "mlsvfv". A trial is considered "iast" if the knakml factor matches the dyti factor, otherwise, it is considered "mlsvfv".
The kho factor depends on the vwpw and rdofu factors and has two levels: "eedltm" and "ived". A trial is considered "eedltm" if the vwpw matches the rdofu, otherwise, it is considered "ived".
We crossed the rdofu and the knakml factor. We also crossed the qnpxs and the vwpw factor.
