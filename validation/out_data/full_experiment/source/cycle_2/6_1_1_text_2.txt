There are six regular factors: kqslu, kjt, trysn, dbp, miayr, and hdrgrk. The kqslu factor consists of two levels: "famp" and "cmff". The kjt factor consists of two levels: "uhoqoh" and "aazgln". The trysn factor consists of two levels: "famp" and "cmff". The dbp factor consists of two levels: "uhoqoh" and "aazgln". The miayr factor consists of two levels: "rfddz" and "tth". The hdrgrk factor consists of two levels: "wbesla" and "kknw". There is one derived factor: xdaerc. The xdaerc factor consists of two levels: "ddfx" and "retip". The xdaerc factor is defined as follows: The "ddfx" level is defined as the level where the kjt factor is equal to the dbp factor. The "retip" level is defined as the level where the kjt factor is not equal to the dbp factor. There is one constraint: At least four trials in a row must have the level "uhoqoh" for the dbp factor.
The xdaerc factor depends on the kjt and dbp factors and has two levels: "ddfx" and "retip". A trial is considered "ddfx" if the kjt matches the dbp, otherwise, it is considered "retip".
We crossed the kjt and the xdaerc factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that at least 4 trials with the level "uhoqoh" in the dbp factor occured in a row.
