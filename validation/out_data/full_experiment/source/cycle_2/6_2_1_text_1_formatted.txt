### REGULAR FACTORS
There are six regular factors: rwbf, pfval, tmqk, zay, axn, and dwra. The rwbf factor consists of two levels: "wnxvop" and "xpjtji". The pfval factor consists of two levels: "vxwj" and "nwvr". The tmqk factor consists of two levels: "wnxvop" and "xpjtji". The zay factor consists of two levels: "vxwj" and "nwvr". The axn factor consists of two levels: "ifj" and "wrhjrn". The dwra factor consists of two levels: "nbowyy" and "jxen".
### DERIVED FACTORS
There are two derived factors: wwbdfd and zyaxqg.
## wwbdfd
The wwbdfd factor depends on the rwbf and tmqk factors and has two levels: "stfge" and "gfxw". A trial is considered "stfge" if the rwbf matches the tmqk, otherwise, it is considered "gfxw".
## zyaxqg
The zyaxqg factor depends on the pfval and dwra factors and has two levels: "oxlyic" and "cmfig". A trial is considered "oxlyic" if the pfval matches the dwra, otherwise, it is considered "cmfig".
### EXPERIMENT
We crossed the dwra and the zyaxqg factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that no more than 2 of the same wwbdfd could occur in a row.
