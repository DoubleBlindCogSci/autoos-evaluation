There are five regular factors: lbb, sndpyx, dwbg, wrzorv, and luu. The lbb factor consists of two levels: "yzmmfa" and "arhbc". The sndpyx factor consists of two levels: "utxa" and "raqlqp". The dwbg factor consists of two levels: "yzmmfa" and "arhbc". The wrzorv factor consists of two levels: "utxa" and "raqlqp". The luu factor consists of two levels: "gqiz" and "qjv". There is one constraint: At most three levels of the luu factor can occur in a row. The luu factor crosses the wrzorv factor.
We crossed the wrzorv and the luu factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that no more than 3 of the same trials could occur in a row.
