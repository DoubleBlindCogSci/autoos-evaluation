There are four regular factors: rffvf, xyxhz, tbgx, and yds. The rffvf factor consists of two levels: "zfi" and "rmut". The xyxhz factor consists of two levels: "qowuql" and "tlat". The tbgx factor consists of two levels: "zfi" and "rmut". The yds factor consists of two levels: "qowuql" and "tlat". There are two constraints: At least four in a row for the tbgx factor and at most four in a row for the xyxhz factor. The tbgx and xyxhz factors are crossed.
We crossed the tbgx and the xyxhz factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to two constraints. First, we allowed for at least 4 of the same tbgx in a row. Second, we allowed for at most 4 of the same xyxhz in a row.
