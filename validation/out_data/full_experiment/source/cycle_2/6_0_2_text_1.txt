There are six regular factors: fihow, xck, ezqy, hqwon, chs, and pxaz. The fihow factor consists of two levels: "jppw" and "ncs". The xck factor consists of two levels: "tvtou" and "ugknb". The ezqy factor consists of two levels: "jppw" and "ncs". The hqwon factor consists of two levels: "tvtou" and "ugknb". The chs factor consists of two levels: "tlyj" and "fbf". The pxaz factor consists of two levels: "bfdnum" and "nlo".
We crossed the fihow and the pxaz factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that at least 4 trials with the same level in the chs factor occured in a row. Also, there were at most 2 trials in a row with the same level in the pxaz factor.
