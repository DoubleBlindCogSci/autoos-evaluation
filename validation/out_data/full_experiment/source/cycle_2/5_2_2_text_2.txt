There are five regular factors: geo, jms, mqhf, rqqs, and xocanv. The geo factor consists of two levels: "nifi" and "dwc". The jms factor consists of two levels: "krfi" and "cwkx". The mqhf factor consists of two levels: "nifi" and "dwc". The rqqs factor consists of two levels: "krfi" and "cwkx". The xocanv factor consists of two levels: "poqlbg" and "gcr". There are two derived factors: cvfre and nkd. The cvfre factor consists of two levels: "tktwoa" and "ljnw". The nkd factor consists of two levels: "gzzjd" and "yan". The cvfre factor is derived from the mqhf and xocanv factors. The nkd factor is derived from the jms and geo factors. The constraints are: At most two jms levels can occur in a row. There must be at least 25 trials. The crossing factors are: mqhf and xocanv.
The cvfre factor depends on the mqhf and xocanv factors and has two levels: "tktwoa" and "ljnw". A trial is considered "tktwoa" if the mqhf factor matches the xocanv factor, otherwise, it is considered "ljnw".
The nkd factor depends on the jms and geo factors and has two levels: "gzzjd" and "yan". A trial is considered "gzzjd" if the jms factor matches the geo factor, otherwise, it is considered "yan".
We crossed the mqhf and the xocanv factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that no more than 2 of the same jms transitions could occur in a row. All experiment sequences contained at least 25 trials.
