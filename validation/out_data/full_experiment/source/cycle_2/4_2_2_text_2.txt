There are four regular factors: nzn, slm, qaufq, and uzqpl. The nzn factor consists of two levels: "nvvtv" and "patw". The slm factor consists of two levels: "boga" and "flif". The qaufq factor consists of two levels: "nvvtv" and "patw". The uzqpl factor consists of two levels: "boga" and "flif". There are two derived factors: ehzalf and jxh. The ehzalf factor consists of two levels: "bsigle" and "hbc". The jxh factor consists of two levels: "safm" and "byfhj". The design is a cross block design. The crossing factors are the derived factors ehzalf and jxh. The constraints are: At least four trials in a row with the level "patw" of the factor qaufq, and at least 15 trials.
The ehzalf factor depends on the slm and qaufq factors and has two levels: "bsigle" and "hbc". A trial is considered "bsigle" if the slm matches the qaufq, otherwise, it is considered "hbc".
The jxh factor depends on the uzqpl and nzn factors and has two levels: "safm" and "byfhj". A trial is considered "safm" if the uzqpl factor matches the nzn factor, otherwise, it is considered "byfhj".
We crossed the nzn and the slm factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that at least 4 trials with the level "patw" in the qaufq factor occured. All experiment sequences contained at least 15 trials.
