There are four regular factors: nzn, slm, qaufq, and uzqpl. The nzn factor consists of two levels: "nvvtv" and "patw". The slm factor also consists of two levels: "boga" and "flif". The qaufq factor consists of two levels: "nvvtv" and "patw". The uzqpl factor consists of two levels: "boga" and "flif".
The ehzalf factor depends on the slm and qaufq factors and has two levels: "bsigle" and "hbc". A trial is considered "bsigle" if the slm matches the qaufq, otherwise, it is considered "hbc".
The jxh factor depends on the uzqpl and nzn factors and has two levels: "safm" and "byfhj". If the uzqpl factor matches the nzn factor, then the trial is considered "safm". Otherwise, the trial is considered "byfhj".
We crossed the jxh and the ehzalf factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that at least 4 trials with the level "patw" in the qaufq factor occured. All experiment sequences contained at least 15 trials.
