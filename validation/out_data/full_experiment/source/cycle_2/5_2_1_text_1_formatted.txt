### REGULAR FACTORS
There are five regular factors: hbqz, ryk, foohw, cduyr, and mij. The hbqz factor consists of two levels: "zdmblf" and "shmy". The ryk factor also consists of two levels: "quezyq" and "xxciv". The foohw factor consists of two levels: "zdmblf" and "shmy". The cduyr factor also consists of two levels: "quezyq" and "xxciv". The mij factor consists of two levels: "lpy" and "grlbm".
### DERIVED FACTORS
There are two derived factors: xflnlc and zoyn.
## xflnlc
The xflnlc factor depends on the hbqz and foohw factors and has two levels: "ydbchl" and "yiu". A trial is considered "ydbchl" if the hbqz matches the foohw, otherwise, it is considered "yiu".
## zoyn
The zoyn factor depends on the cduyr and mij factors and has two levels: "lsolqn" and "una". A trial is considered "lsolqn" if the cduyr matches the mij, otherwise, it is considered "una".
### EXPERIMENT
We crossed the zoyn and the hbqz factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that at least 4 trials with the level "ydbchl" in the xflnlc factor occured.
