There are six regular factors: fihow, xck, ezqy, hqwon, chs, and pxaz. The fihow factor consists of two levels: "jppw" and "ncs". The xck factor consists of two levels: "tvtou" and "ugknb". The ezqy factor consists of two levels: "jppw" and "ncs". The hqwon factor consists of two levels: "tvtou" and "ugknb". The chs factor consists of two levels: "tlyj" and "fbf". The pxaz factor consists of two levels: "bfdnum" and "nlo". The fihow and pxaz factors are crossed. The chs factor has the constraint that at least four consecutive levels must be the same. The pxaz factor has the constraint that at most two consecutive levels must be the same.
We crossed the fihow and the pxaz factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to two constraints. First, we allowed for at least 4 trials in a row with the level "tlyj" in the chs factor. Second, we allowed for at most 2 trials in a row with the level "bfdnum" in the pxaz factor.
