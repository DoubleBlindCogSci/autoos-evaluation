There are six regular factors: engo, kctkp, vnp, qid, itpxp, and gxh. The engo factor consists of two levels: "lbjuv" and "dyo". The kctkp factor consists of two levels: "izl" and "rgaqux". The vnp factor consists of two levels: "lbjuv" and "dyo". The qid factor consists of two levels: "izl" and "rgaqux". The itpxp factor consists of two levels: "jpnqdt" and "uai". The gxh factor consists of two levels: "gbrd" and "ncogvs".
The jfvhy factor depends on the vnp and gxh factors and has two levels: "gqppy" and "nyza". A trial is considered "gqppy" if the vnp matches the gxh, otherwise, it is considered "nyza".
The oclt factor depends on the engo and qid factors and has two levels: "vbw" and "qqz". A trial is considered "vbw" if the engo matches the qid, otherwise, it is considered "qqz".
We crossed the jfvhy and the itpxp factor.
