There are six regular factors: engo, kctkp, vnp, qid, itpxp, and gxh. The engo factor consists of two levels: "lbjuv" and "dyo". The kctkp factor consists of two levels: "izl" and "rgaqux". The vnp factor consists of two levels: "lbjuv" and "dyo". The qid factor consists of two levels: "izl" and "rgaqux". The itpxp factor consists of two levels: "jpnqdt" and "uai". The gxh factor consists of two levels: "gbrd" and "ncogvs". There are two derived factors: jfvhy and oclt. The jfvhy factor consists of two levels: "gqppy" and "nyza". The oclt factor consists of two levels: "vbw" and "qqz". The jfvhy factor is crossed with the itpxp factor. The oclt factor is crossed with the engo and qid factors.
The jfvhy factor depends on the vnp and gxh factors and has two levels: "gqppy" and "nyza". A trial is considered "gqppy" if the vnp matches the gxh, otherwise, it is considered "nyza".
The oclt factor depends on the engo and qid factors and has two levels: "vbw" and "qqz". A trial is considered "vbw" if the engo matches the qid, otherwise, it is considered "qqz".
We crossed the jfvhy and the itpxp factor.
