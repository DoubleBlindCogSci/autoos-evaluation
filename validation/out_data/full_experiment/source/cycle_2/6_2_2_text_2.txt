There are six regular factors: cxac, byvob, ayfgq, tnd, uwgbrp, and phb. The cxac factor consists of two levels: "alpai" and "mdiei". The byvob factor consists of two levels: "juc" and "bzdi". The ayfgq factor consists of two levels: "alpai" and "mdiei". The tnd factor consists of two levels: "juc" and "bzdi". The uwgbrp factor consists of two levels: "gnyajh" and "bqg". The phb factor consists of two levels: "mjyfwo" and "jea". There are two derived factors: funv and bkcnhy. The funv factor consists of two levels: "jrhlqv" and "axyuo". The bkcnhy factor consists of two levels: "cfae" and "ljbbi". There are two constraints: At least three "juc" levels in a row in the byvob factor and at most four "gnyajh" levels in a row in the uwgbrp factor. The cxac and byvob factors are crossed.
The funv factor depends on the phb and uwgbrp factors and has two levels: "jrhlqv" and "axyuo". A trial is considered "jrhlqv" if the phb factor matches the uwgbrp factor. Otherwise, the trial is considered "axyuo".
The bkcnhy factor depends on the cxac and tnd factors and has two levels: "cfae" and "ljbbi". A trial is considered "cfae" if the cxac matches the tnd, otherwise, it is considered "ljbbi".
We crossed the cxac and the byvob factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that at least 3 "juc" trials were in a row. Also, there were at most 4 "gnyajh" trials in a row.
