### REGULAR FACTORS
There are six regular factors: kqslu, kjt, trysn, dbp, miayr, and hdrgrk. The kqslu factor consists of two levels: "famp" and "cmff". The kjt factor consists of two levels: "uhoqoh" and "aazgln". The trysn factor consists of two levels: "famp" and "cmff". The dbp factor consists of two levels: "uhoqoh" and "aazgln". The miayr factor consists of two levels: "rfddz" and "tth". The hdrgrk factor consists of two levels: "wbesla" and "kknw".
### DERIVED FACTORS
There is a derived factor called xdaerc.
## xdaerc
The xdaerc factor depends on the kjt and dbp factors and has two levels: "ddfx" and "retip". If the kjt matches the dbp, then the trial is "ddfx". Otherwise, the trial is "retip".
### EXPERIMENT
We crossed the kjt and the xdaerc factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that at least 4 trials with the level "uhoqoh" in the dbp factor occured in a row.
