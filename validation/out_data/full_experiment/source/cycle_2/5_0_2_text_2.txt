There are five regular factors: xsoc, qzjdvx, syz, qgx, and oubi. The xsoc factor consists of two levels: "aick" and "thojyk". The qzjdvx factor consists of two levels: "orlug" and "condlo". The syz factor consists of two levels: "aick" and "thojyk". The qgx factor consists of two levels: "orlug" and "condlo". The oubi factor consists of two levels: "rnje" and "wawxwx". There are two constraints: At least two "orlug" levels in a row in the qgx factor and exactly two "aick" levels in a row in the qzjdvx factor. The factors qgx and syz are crossed.
We crossed the qgx and the syz factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that at least 2 "orlug" trials were in a row. Also there were always exactly 2 "aick" trials in a row.
