There are four regular factors: oxt, jvg, moskvk, and ijmr. The oxt factor consists of two levels: "sivho" and "cqbgic". The jvg factor also consists of two levels: "ohs" and "wpyrc". The moskvk factor consists of two levels: "sivho" and "cqbgic". The ijmr factor also consists of two levels: "ohs" and "wpyrc".
The knmejn factor depends on the ijmr and moskvk factors and has two levels: "dhmqoa" and "tgtul". A trial is considered "dhmqoa" if the ijmr matches the moskvk, otherwise, it is considered "tgtul".
The imxuu factor depends on the oxt and jvg factors and has two levels: "ajirpt" and "nozlj". If the oxt factor matches the jvg factor, then the trial is considered "ajirpt". Otherwise, the trial is considered "nozlj".
We crossed the moskvk and the oxt factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that no more than 2 of the same oxt transitions could occur in a row.
