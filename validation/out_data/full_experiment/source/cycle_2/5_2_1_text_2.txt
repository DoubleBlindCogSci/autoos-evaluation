There are five regular factors: hbqz, ryk, foohw, cduyr, and mij. The hbqz factor consists of two levels: "zdmblf" and "shmy". The ryk factor consists of two levels: "quezyq" and "xxciv". The foohw factor consists of two levels: "zdmblf" and "shmy". The cduyr factor consists of two levels: "quezyq" and "xxciv". The mij factor consists of two levels: "lpy" and "grlbm". There are two derived factors: xflnlc and zoyn. The xflnlc factor consists of two levels: "ydbchl" and "yiu". The zoyn factor consists of two levels: "lsolqn" and "una". The design is a cross-block design. The crossing factors are zoyn and hbqz. The constraints are: At least four trials in a row with the level "ydbchl" of the factor xflnlc.
The xflnlc factor depends on the hbqz and foohw factors and has two levels: "ydbchl" and "yiu". A trial is considered "ydbchl" if the hbqz factor matches the foohw factor, otherwise, it is considered "yiu".
The zoyn factor depends on the cduyr and mij factors and has two levels: "lsolqn" and "una". A trial is considered "lsolqn" if the cduyr matches the mij, otherwise, it is considered "una".
We crossed the hbqz and the ryk factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that at least 4 "ydbchl" trials were in a row.
