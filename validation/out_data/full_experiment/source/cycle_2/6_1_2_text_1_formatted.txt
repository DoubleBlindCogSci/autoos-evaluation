### REGULAR FACTORS
There are six regular factors: zuqn, iob, mdz, hmoud, ibonqh, and ktcou. The zuqn factor consists of two levels: "rqu" and "yzh". The iob factor consists of two levels: "wsep" and "xvci". The mdz factor consists of two levels: "rqu" and "yzh". The hmoud factor consists of two levels: "wsep" and "xvci". The ibonqh factor consists of two levels: "tyyna" and "knxo". The ktcou factor consists of two levels: "vwbsg" and "wwqtz".
### DERIVED FACTORS
There is a derived factor called hci.
## hci
The hci factor depends on the zuqn and iob factors and has two levels: "gzrsh" and "fbv". A trial is considered "gzrsh" if the zuqn matches the iob, otherwise, it is considered "fbv".
### EXPERIMENT
We crossed the mdz and the hci factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that exactly 4 trials in a row with the level "gzrsh" in the hci factor occured. Also, there were always at least 2 trials in a row with the level "rqu" in the zuqn factor.
