There are six regular factors: zuqn, iob, mdz, hmoud, ibonqh, and ktcou. The zuqn factor consists of two levels: "rqu" and "yzh". The iob factor consists of two levels: "wsep" and "xvci". The mdz factor consists of two levels: "rqu" and "yzh". The hmoud factor consists of two levels: "wsep" and "xvci". The ibonqh factor consists of two levels: "tyyna" and "knxo". The ktcou factor consists of two levels: "vwbsg" and "wwqtz". There are two derived factors: hci and gzrsh. The hci factor consists of two levels: "gzrsh" and "fbv". The gzrsh factor consists of two levels: "rqu" and "yzh". There are two constraints: At least two "rqu" levels in a row and exactly four "gzrsh" levels in a row.
The hci factor depends on the zuqn and iob factors and has two levels: "gzrsh" and "fbv". A trial is considered "gzrsh" if the zuqn matches the iob, otherwise, it is considered "fbv".
We crossed the mdz and the hci factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that at least 2 trials with the level "rqu" in the zuqn factor occured. Also, there were always exactly 4 trials in a row with the level "gzrsh" in the hci factor.
