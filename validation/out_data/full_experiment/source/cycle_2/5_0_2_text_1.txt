There are five regular factors: xsoc, qzjdvx, syz, qgx, and oubi. The xsoc factor consists of two levels: "aick" and "thojyk". The qzjdvx factor consists of two levels: "orlug" and "condlo". The syz factor consists of two levels: "aick" and "thojyk". The qgx factor consists of two levels: "orlug" and "condlo". The oubi factor consists of two levels: "rnje" and "wawxwx".
We crossed the qgx and the syz factor. However, the experiment sequences were generated subject to the constraint that at least 2 trials in a row with the level "orlug" in the qgx factor occured. Also, there were always exactly 2 trials in a row with the level "aick" in the qzjdvx factor.
