The djw factor depends on the factors taaa and vcz and has three levels: "plpx", "mlkbl", and "dosx". If the taaa factor is "fil", then the trial is considered "plpx". If the taaa factor is not "fil" and the vcz factor is "bio", then the trial is considered "mlkbl". Otherwise, the trial is considered "dosx".

The wdd factor depends on the factors jbus, xrnu, and hyvj and has three levels: "xvgc", "yfck", and "djnv". A trial is considered "xvgc" if the jbus factor matches the xrnu factor or the xrnu factor is "hja". A trial is considered "yfck" if the jbus factor matches the hyvj factor and does not match the xrnu factor. A trial is considered "djnv" if the jbus factor does not match the xrnu factor and does not match the hyvj factor.
